abstract = {[1] Numerical models that calculate the fluid dynamics of explosive volcanic eruptions have been used with increasing frequency to understand volcanic processes and evaluate volcanic hazards. Yet those who develop such models rarely make them publicly available so that they can be verified, used, and possibly improved by other scientists. In this paper I present a visual, interactive, open-source numerical model that calculates steady state flow of magma and gas in vertical eruptive conduits and contains user-friendly utilities for quickly determining physical, thermodynamic, and transport properties of silicate melts, H 2 O gases, and melt-gas-crystal mixtures. The model represents an advance over previously published conduit models by incorporating a non-Arrhenian viscosity relation for hydrous silicate melts, a relation between viscosity and volume fraction of gas that depends on Capillary number, and adiabatic temperature changes in the mixture using established thermodynamic relations for melts and H 2 O gas, respectively. Volcanologists who have not had access to conduit models have frequently approximated conduit flow using an analytical equation for incompressible, laminar, Newtonian pipe flow, which predicts that the mass flux is proportional to the fourth power of conduit radius and inversely proportional to mixture viscosity. The model presented here, which is not much more difficult to use than a back-of-the-envelope calculation, shows that the pipe-flow approximation significantly overestimates the sensitivity of mass flux to both conduit radius and mixture viscosity. Results from the model also show that viscous heating in the lower conduit, which is not considered in most other models, may increase the mass flux of large silicic eruptions by several percent and decrease the viscosity of the mixture at the fragmentation depth by a few tens of percent.

abstract = {We made field explosion experiments as an analogue of volcanic explosion to understand the relationship between the explosion condition and the resultant surface phenomena. The main parameters we employed were explosion depth and explosion energy. Through the experiments we confirmed that scaled depth, which is the depth divided by cube root of energy, is the main parameter determining the properties of explosive volcanism. The energy assigned to blast wave decreased exponentially against the scaled depth. The scaled crater diameter became maximum when the scaled depth was about 4 × 10−3 m/J¹/³.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nScaled crater diameters by nuclear, chemical subsurface and some volcanic explosions were almost the same. From the scaling law, the overpressure at crater rim was estimated to be several MPa, which corresponded to typical rock strength. Probably the ground‐forming materials were broken inside the area where overpressure exceeded their strength.},

abstract = {The 2007 effusive eruption of Stromboli volcano produced a ground deformation detected by two high-resolution borehole tiltmeters installed at an elevation {\textgreater} 500??masl and at a distance of {\textless} 800??m from the active vents. Ground inflation was recorded about 12??h before the eruption onset as a consequence of magma ascent within the shallow feeding conduit. Tilt vectors converging towards the summit area indicate a confined or vertically elongated source. The increased magma input rate led to a well alimented lava flow, which was detected as a major tilt deflation during the 6??days following the eruption onset. Unlike during the inflation, the ground deformation that accompanied the lava effusion, is not consistent with a confined source close to the summit area, but rather suggests a process of deflation of the volcanic structure along a dyke-shaped structure striking 40??N. The tilt data presented in this paper represent a great opportunity to investigate the mechanism of magma effusion and the response of the feeding system to the increased magma flux. High value of seismic tremor amplitude and surface fracturing is the evidence of the increased magma input rate, which led to the SW-NE propagation of the dike, acting as a linear source of deflation when the system was rapidly drained by the sustained lava emission. A secondary inflation process, acting during the tilt decay, was clearly recorded in the afternoon on February 27 2007, representing the evidence of the magma intrusion, that led to the opening of an effusive vent at 400??m elevation. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This review covers basic theory and techniques behind the use of ground-based gravimetry at the Earth's surface. The orientation is toward modern instrumentation, data processing and interpretation for observing surface, land-based, time-variable changes to the geopotential. The instrumentation side is covered in some detail, with specifications and performance of the most widely used models of the three main types: the absolute gravimeters (FG5, A10 from Micro-g LaCoste), superconducting gravimeters (OSG, iGrav from GWR instruments), and the new generation of spring instruments (Micro-g LaCoste gPhone, Scintrex CG5 and Burris ZLS). A wide range of applications is covered, with selected examples from tides and ocean loading, atmospheric effects on gravity, local and global hydrology, seismology and normal modes, long period and tectonics, volcanology, exploration gravimetry, and some examples of gravimetry connected to fundamental physics. We show that there are only a modest number of very large signals, i.e. hundreds of µGal (10(-8) m s(-2)), that are easy to see with all gravimeters (e.g. tides, volcanic eruptions, large earthquakes, seasonal hydrology). The majority of signals of interest are in the range 0.1-5.0 µGal and occur at a wide range of time scales (minutes to years) and spatial extent (a few meters to global). Here the competing effects require a careful combination of different gravimeter types and measurement strategies to efficiently characterize and distinguish the signals. Gravimeters are sophisticated instruments, with substantial up-front costs, and they place demands on the operators to maximize the results. Nevertheless their performance characteristics such as drift and precision have improved dramatically in recent years, and their data recording ability and ruggedness have seen similar advances. Many subtle signals are now routinely connected with known geophysical effects such as coseismic earthquake displacements, post-glacial rebound, local hydrological mass balances, and detection of non-steric sea level changes.},

@article{Head1989,
abstract = {In basaltic pyroclastic eruptions, two variables - magma gas content and magma volume flux - determine the detailed dynamic structure of the fountain and the size distribution of clasts within it. The fountain structure and clast size distribution in turn determine the nature of the resulting deposits, whether these be stationary pyroclastic constructs or active lava flows. Although the physical relationships between gas content and clast size are not fully understood, empirical data are available for basaltic eruptions. Fountain dynamic structure is determined by the velocity profile at any given pressure level and the maximum spread angle of the fountain from the vertical. These two parameters completely determine the paths of pyroclasts in the fountain and their ultimate resting places. The combination of the pyroclast size and the spatial distribution determines the clast number density and thus the opacity of the fountain and the ability of the pyroclasts to cool in their local fountain environment. For a given set of conditions, two factors thus become important in determining the structure and morphology of pyroclastic deposits: local temperature and accumulation rate. For example, in typical basaltic pyroclastic eruptions, the majority of pyroclasts remain inside the optically thick central part of the fountain, undergo minimal cooling, and return to the surface to coalesce and contribute to a lava pond or lava flow. In the optically thinner outer parts of the fountain, clasts undergo relatively more cooling and return to the surface to contribute to the building of the pyroclastic cone (if the accumulation rate is low) or to form rootless flows (if the accumulation rate is high and minimal further cooling occurs). The relationships between these various parameters are investigated for Hawaiian-style eruptions in general and applied qualitatively to the interpretation of post-eruption deposits. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Diatremes provide partial records of how dyke-delivered magma, periodically interacting with water, produces the largest known cylindrical conduit structures of any volcano type. We address how pre-eruptive country rock is disrupted and redistributed to form the diatreme structure during an eruption by establishing the internal architecture of the unbedded diatreme at Standing Rocks West, and the volumes and sources of wall-rock within the diatreme and in a complementary tephra ring at Teshim, both in the Hopi Buttes volcanic field. The unbedded diatreme is dominantly exposed as a massif comprising multiple subvertical columns, interpreted as ephemeral-conduit deposits of well-mixed, poorly sorted, composite and juvenile pyroclast-rich deposits that truncate marginal layered deposits, plus a peripheral heterolithic country rock breccia. Wall-rock clasts are scarce in the massif and were mainly sourced from {\~{}}75 to 245 m depth below the paleosurface. By contrast, the tephra ring has abundant wall-rock fragments, dominantly from the upper 75 m of the pre-eruptive sedimentary sequence. The diatreme structure is interpreted to have been formed by many small-volume explosions fed by a low flux of basaltic magma. Late stage explosive activity was rooted mostly within pyroclastic debris at shallow to intermediate depths within the diatreme structure. This resulted in damped and shifting intra-diatreme explosions and jets that facilitated gradual mixing, recycling and remobilization of debris in the diatreme, with incremental addition of juvenile material and possibly a local rise in the crater floor.},

abstract = {[1] The exposed top of the conduit system at Mount Erebus Volcano, Ross Island, Antarctica, is a convecting lava ( magma) lake hosting Strombolian eruptions caused by the explosive decompression of large (up to 5 m radius) gas slugs. Short-period (SP; f greater than or equal to 1 Hz) seismoacoustic eruption seismograms are accompanied by oscillatory very long period (VLP) signals observed in the near field by broadband seismometers 0.7 to 2.5 km from the lava lake. A variable VLP onset, preceding eruptions by several seconds, is followed by a repeatable VLP coda that persists for several minutes until the lava lake recovers to its preeruptive level. VLP signals are dominated by distinct decaying nonharmonic modes, the largest at periods of 20.7, 11.3, and 7.8 s, with respective source Q values of approximately 11, 18, and 4. Particle motions indicate a temporally evolving source producing increasingly vertical posteruptive displacements as the signal decays. VLP scalar moments, up to similar to 5 x 10(11) N m, exceed SP moments by an order of magnitude or more, suggesting distinct, though genetically related, SP and VLP source mechanisms. We conclude that VLP signals arise from excitation of a quasi-linear resonator that is intimately associated with the conduit system and is excited by gravity and inertial forces associated with gas slug ascent, eruption, and magma recharge. VLP signal stability across hundreds of eruptions spanning 5 years, the persistence of the lava lake, and the rapid posteruptive lava lake recovery indicate a stable near-summit magma reservoir and VLP source process.},

abstract = {The 2004-05 eruption of Mount St Helens exhibited sustained, near-equilibrium behaviour characterized by relatively steady extrusion of a solid dacite plug and nearly periodic shallow earthquakes. Here we present a diverse data set to support our hypothesis that these earthquakes resulted from stick-slip motion along the margins of the plug as it was forced incrementally upwards by ascending, solidifying, gas-poor magma. We formalize this hypothesis with a dynamical model that reveals a strong analogy between behaviour of the magma-plug system and that of a variably damped oscillator. Modelled stick-slip oscillations have properties that help constrain the balance of forces governing the earthquakes and eruption, and they imply that magma pressure never deviated much from the steady equilibrium pressure. We infer that the volcano was probably poised in a near-eruptive equilibrium state long before the onset of the 2004-05 eruption.},

abstract = {The theory describing the behavior of glacier crevasses that are partially filled with water is developed further, and the results are applied to the problem of vertical magma transport beneath oceanic ridges. It is assumed that lava collects beneath the center of a ridge. According to the theory, if a tensile stress acts across a ridge that is cold enough to behave like an elastic plate, a crack filled with liquid rock will nucleate at the bottom surface of the plate. This crack will increase in length and volume, pinch its lower end shut, and finally rise toward the top surface. (The immediate driving force causing the crack to rise is the Peach-Koehler force, which acts on dislocations. In the case of the liquid-filled crack the Peach-Koehler force produces a total, pseudo-Archimedian force that is identical in form to the true Archimedian buoyancy force on a solid within a liquid.) Eventually the crack will stop, and the lava in it will freeze and cause the oceanic ridge to spread somewhat. Lava will spill out onto the top surface only if an oversize crack reaches the upper surface. A crack that has been preceeded by other cracks on its upward journey will be trapped in the interior of the plate and its lava will freeze in place.},

@article{Yamasaki2018,
abstract = {Geodetic signals observed at volcanoes, particularly their temporal patterns, have required us to make the correlation between the surface displacement and magmatic process at depth in terms of viscoelastic crustal rheology. Here we use a parallelized 3-D finite element model to examine the response of the linear Maxwell viscoelastic crust and mantle to the inflation of a sill in order to show the characteristics of a long-term volcano deformation. In the model, an oblate-spheroidal sill is instantaneously or gradually inflated in a two-layered medium that consists of an elastic layer underlain by a viscoelastic layer. Our numerical experiments show that syn-inflation surface uplift is followed by post-inflation surface subsidence as the viscoelastic substrate relaxes. For gradual inflation events, the magnitude of inflation-induced uplift is reduced by the relaxation, through which the volume of a magma inferred by matching the prediction of an elastic model with observed surface uplift could be underestimated. For a given crustal viscosity, sill depth is the principal factor controlling subsidence caused by viscoelastic relaxation. The subsidence rate is highest when the inflation occurs at the boundary between the elastic and the viscoelastic layers. The mantle viscosity has an insignificant impact unless the depth of the inflation is greater than a half the crustal thickness. We apply the viscoelastic model to the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data in the Kutcharo caldera, eastern Hokkaido, Japan, where the surface has slowly subsided over a period of approximately three years following about a two-year period of inflation. The emplacement of a magmatic sill is constrained to occur at a depth of {\~{}} 4.5 km, which is significantly shallower than the geophysically imaged large-scale magma chamber. The geodetically detected deformation in the caldera reflects the small-scale emplacement of a magma that ascended from the deeper chamber, but not the inflation of the chamber itself. The observed ground displacement is controlled by a lower-crustal viscosity of {\~{}} 4 × 1017Pa s, which is lower than that inferred from some studies of post-seismic deformation, perhaps due to higher temperatures beneath the active caldera. Our results suggest that geodetic signals observed during and following magmatic intrusions need to be revisited.},

abstract = {We use infrasound waves generated during eruptions of Volc{\'{a}}n Tungurahua (Ecuador) to study both, changing atmospheric conditions and volcanic source characteristics. Analyzed infrasound data were recorded for a 32-month period by a five-station network located within 6.5 km from the vent. We use cross-network correlation to quantify the recurrent eruptive behavior of Tungurahua and results are corroborated by reports from the Ecuadorian monitoring agency. Cross-network lag times vary over short time periods (minutes to days) when vent location is stable and attribute these variations to changes in atmospheric structure. Assuming a fixed source location, we invert for average air temperatures and winds in Tungurahua's vicinity ({\textless} 6.5 km) and find evidence for diurnal and semidiurnal tropospheric tides. We also use cross-network correlation lag times to compute infrasound source positions with resolutions of {\~{}} 11.6 m, taking into account coarse NOAA atmospheric models for local winds and temperatures. Variable infrasound-derived source locations suggest source migration during the 32 months of analyzed data. Such source position variability is expected following energetic eruptions that destructively altered the crater/vent morphology as confirmed by imagery obtained during regular overflights.},

abstract = {A nonlinear process analogous to the excitation mechanism of musical wind instruments and human vocal cords can explain many characteristics of volcanic tremor, including (1) periodic and ''chaotic'' oscillations, with peaked and irregular spectra respectively, (2) rapid pulsations in eruptions occurring at the same frequency as tremor, (3) systematic changes in tremor amplitude as channel geometry evolves during an eruption, (4) the period doubling reported for Hawaiian deep tremor, and (5) the fact that the onset of tremor can be either gradual or abrupt. Volcanic ''long-period'' earthquakes can be explained as oscillations excited by transient disturbances produced by nearby earthquakes, fluid heterogeneity, or changes in channel geometry, when the magma flow rate is too low to excite continuous tremor. A simple lumped-parameter tremor model involving the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid through a channel with movable elastic walls leads to a third-order system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. For different driving fluid pressures, numerical solutions exhibit steady flow, simple limit-cycle oscillations, a cascade of period-doubling subharmonic bifurcations, and chaotic oscillations controlled by a strange attractor of Rossler type. In this model, tremor occurs most easily at local constrictions, and fluid discharge is lower than would occur in unstable steady flow.},

abstract = {During a phase of high eruptive activity, as well as high tremor activity, seismic signals were recorded at Bromo Volcano (East Java) for almost three months in 1995. The signals generated by the volcano cover a broad frequency range including long period signals with frequencies between 10 and 100 mHz, tremor signals at about 5 Hz and volcanic shocks with frequencies up to 25 Hz. Seismic signals from volcanoes, especially tremors, have been classified and categorized in different ways, but interpretation has always been limited by the difficulties in determining even approximate source locations. Volcanic tremor lacks an emergent first onset, while the complex structure of the volcano makes it difficult to determine other phases from shock signals than first arrivals. If the volcanic signal has been recorded in at least two stations, the location of its seismic source can be estimated using a grid search method if we assume the source radiates isotropically in a homogeneous medium. Applying the grid method to data recorded at Mt. Bromo, we determine the locations of the sources of tremor and shock signals. The sources for both types of signals are located in the northwestern part of the crater, near the open vent and also near the source of long period signals (Gottschammer, 1999. Annal.

abstract = {Characteristics of convective flows produced by buoyancy of small bubbles rising from the horizontal bottom of a thin water layer are investigated with laboratory experiments, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis for steady convection cells. Immediately after the production of bubbles, small plumes of bubble-contained fluid are produced by Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The laboratory experiment suggests that the convective pattern is modified from plumes to cellular convection when the plumes reach the top of the fluid layer. There is a tendency for the aspect ratio of the cell to increase with the bubble flux, and this tendency was confirmed by numerical simulations. The analysis for steady convection cells also derived consistent solutions: a convection cell with too large a horizontal scale cannot be sustained, and the critical scale increases with the flux of the bubbles. The convective patterns in the final stage depend mainly upon the volume flux (F) of the bubbles and the rising velocity (wb) of a bubble in a still fluid. According to the numerical simulation, the steady cellular pattern is obtained only in limited combinations of F and wb. It is also found that the steady organized cellular convection is only sustained in a system without diffusion of the buoyancy. If the buoyancy diffuses across the trajectories of bubbles, the cellular convection eventually disappears. In the final steady state the buoyancy is transported only by the rising velocity of bubbles. In this respect, this convective motion is quite different from B{\'{e}}nard convection where the steady cellular convection is maintained in a diffusive system. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Following the eruption of January 1992, episodes of lava dome growth accompanied by generation of dome-collapse nu{\'{e}}es ardentes occurred in 1994-1998. In addition, nu{\'{e}}es ardentes were generated by fountain-collapse in January 1997, and the 1998 events also suggest an explosive component. Significant tilt and seismic precursors on varying time scales preceded these events. Deformation about the summit has been detected by electronic tiltmeters since November 1992, with inflation corresponding generally to lava dome growth, and deflation (or decreased inflation) corresponding to loss of dome mass. Strong short-term (days to weeks) accelerations in tilt rate and seismicity occurred prior to the major nu{\'{e}}es ardentes episodes, apart from those of 22 November 1994 which were preceded by steadily increasing tilt for over 200 days but lacked short-term precursors. Because of the combination of populated hazardous areas and the lack of an issued warning, about 100 casualties occurred in 1994. In contrast, the strong precursors in 1997 and 1998 provided advance warning to observatory scientists, enabled the stepped raising of alert levels, and aided hazard management. As a result of these factors, but also the fortunate fact that the large nu{\'{e}}es ardentes did not quite descend into populated areas, no casualties occurred. The nu{\'{e}}e ardente episode of 1994 is interpreted as purely due to gravitational collapse, whereas those of 1997 and 1998 were influenced by gas-pressurization of the lava dome.},

@article{Castro2014,
abstract = {A widely cited idea is that the explosive-to-effusive transition manifests a two-stage degassing history whereby lava is the product of non-explosive, open-system gas release following initial explosive, closed-system degassing. Direct observations of rhyolite eruptions indicate that effusive rhyolites are in fact highly explosive, as they erupt simultaneously with violent volcanic blasts and pyroclastic fountains for months from a common vent. This explosive and effusive overlap suggests that pyroclastic processes play a key role in rendering silicic magma sufficiently degassed to generate lava. Here we use precise H-isotope and magmatic H2O measurements and textural evidence to demonstrate that effusion results from explosion(s)-lavas are the direct product of brittle deformation that fosters batched degassing into transient pyroclastic channels (tuffisites) that repetitively and explosively vent from effusing lava. Our measurements show, specifically that D/H ratios and H2O contents of a broad suite of explosive and effusive samples from Chait{\'{e}}n volcano (hydrous bombs, Plinian pyroclasts, tuffisite veins, and lava) define a single and continuous degassing trend that links wet explosive pyroclasts ({\~{}}1.6 wt.{\%} H2O, $\delta$D = - 76.4≥) to dry obsidian lavas ({\~{}}0.13 wt.{\%} H2O, $\delta$D = - 145.7≥). This geochemical pattern is best fit with batched degassing model that comprises small repeated closed-system degassing steps followed by pulses of vapour extraction. This degassing mechanism is made possible by the action of tuffisite veins, which, by tapping already vesicular or brecciated magma, allow batches of exsolved gas to rapidly and explosively escape from relatively isolated closed-system domains and large tracts of conduit magma by giving them long-range connectivity. Even though tuffisite veins render magma degassed and capable of effusing, they are nonetheless the avenues of violent gas and particle transport and thus have the potential to drive explosions when they become blocked or welded shut. Thus the effusion of silicic lava, traditionally thought to be relatively benign process, presents a particularly hazardous form of explosive volcanism. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Hoei eruption of Mount Fuji in 1707 caused the worst ashfall disaster in Japanese history. Despite the availability of numerous historical documents describing the eruption, the detailed eruption sequence has not been verified because the correlation between these descriptions and geological sequences remains unclear. In this study, we reconstruct the sequential change in the column height using newly established stratigraphy and a detailed timeline obtained from historical documents.The eruptive deposit was subdivided into 17 units on the basis of their facies, with the mass of each unit established using isopach maps. The eruption column height is a function of the magma discharge rate; hence, the column height of each unit was estimated from its erupted mass and duration, which were inferred from the historical documents. The correlation of each unit with the actual time was based on the tephra color and grain size, an unconformity caused by rainfall, and ashfall distribution.While reconstructing the unit boundaries, we found that not all of them represented a hiatus or relenting phase of ashfall. We detected only six obvious quiet intervals from the historical documents. Therefore, many of the unit boundaries may represent a hiatus or relenting phase that was too subtle to have been recorded in the historical documents. We define an eruptive pulse as a period of continuous ashfall followed by an obvious quiet interval. We divided the 17 units of the Hoei eruption into 6 pulses, and into 3 stages on the basis of the patterns of the eruptive pulses. The characteristics of the three stages are described as follows.Stage 1 had two energetic eruptive pulses (pulses 1 and 2; at least 20. km high column), each showing an intense initial outburst, followed by a decrease in intensity. The eruption sequence indicates ruptures of highly overpressured dacite and andesite magma chambers. The initial silicic eruption was followed by basaltic magma withdrawal from a deep and voluminous magma chamber. Stage II consisted of discrete subplinian pulses of relatively degassed basaltic magma. Although the eruption rate throughout the stage decreased, the magma supply from depth appears to have been sustained because extensive intrusion near the surface created the Mt. Hoei cryptodome near the vent. Stage III was principally characterized by sustained column activity without a clear repose time. During this stage, the column height appears to have been more than 13. km, and we recognized at least two distinct periods of increased activity in which the column height is presumed to have exceeded 16. km. The Cu-rich vesicular scoria and continuous eruption in stage III indicate a stable supply of volatile-rich magma from depth. No significant decay was observed in the magma discharge rate; hence, the eruption could have been halted by a sudden process such as conduit collapse, rather than decompression of the magma chamber. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Volcanic explosion earthquakes accompanying explosive eruptions are viewed as representing an abrupt release of pressurized magma beneath a volcano through a vent. I examine the source mechanisms of explosion earthquakes assuming two extreme cases of magma property. When magma is assumed to be a perfect gas which migrates upward isentropically through a vent acting as a nozzle, the seismic source is expressed as a single force. On the other hand, when magma flow is assumed to be incompressible, an implosive source is dominant. Both source models predict that the seismic magnitude is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the vent. I investigate observed seismic magnitudes for different volcanoes based on data in published papers and reports. The results show that the seismic magnitude of the largest event for each volcano is essentially proportional to the cross-sectional area of the vent for vent radii ranging from 10 to 600 m. The consistency found between the theoretical prediction and the observed relation suggests that the vent area plays a substantial role in the magnitude of explosion earthquakes. I further estimate that initial pressures in the reservoir are of the order of a few MPa, with a one order of magnitude uncertainty based on the single force model. I also apply the implosive source model to the observed seismic magnitudes and estimate the product of bulk modulus of magma and flow velocity to be 1010-1011J/m2s.},

abstract = {The decompression rate of magma is correlated with explosivity of volcanic eruptions. present a series of decompression experiments in a shock tube apparatus to investigate the effect of decompression rate on the expansion and eruption style of bubbly fluids. We also consider the effects of the pressure change $\Delta$P and initial vesicularity $\phi$i. As an analogue for magma we use viscoelastic polymer solutions. For fast decompression, we observe fragmentation and rupture of bubble walls only for large $\Delta$P and large $\phi$i. For slow decompression, however, bubbles maintain spherical shapes, and the bubbly fluid does not fragment, irrespective of $\Delta$P and $\phi$i. We consider two theoretical estimates for the expansion of bubbles, which we refer to as "equilibrium expansion," in which the pressures inside and outside the bubbles are assumed to be equal, and "disequilibrium expansion," in which the enthalpy change caused by the pressure change is converted into kinetic energy. The observed expansion velocity is governed by the slower estimate. For slow decompression, where bubbles expand while maintaining their spherical shape, the measured expansion is well explained by equilibrium expansion. In contrast, for fast decompression, in which we observe the rupture of bubble walls and fragmentation, the expansion follows disequilibrium expansion. We conclude that the disequilibrium estimate is an upper limit velocity for the bubble expansion and fragmentation and the rupture of bubble walls require disequilibrium expansion. The calculated threshold decompression rate for disequilibrium expansion is consistent with the estimated decompression rate for the explosive/effusive transition in natural basaltic eruptions.

Computational modelling of the one-phase flow is carried out and results are confronted with experimental data and the different modelling approaches are discussed.},

abstract = {The understanding of processes within the root zone of maar-diatreme volcanoes is important for the interpretation of the geology, volcanology and even hazard assessment of these volcanoes. In the phreatomagmatic model of pipe formation, the irregularly shaped root zone is the site of the phreatomagmatic explosions, and thus functions as the "engine" for pipe formation. In this model the root zone grows over a period of time in a series of many single thermohydraulic, i.e. phreatomagmatic, explosions. The explosions initially occur close to the surface and with ongoing explosive activity penetrate towards deeper levels. The ejection of country rock clasts from the root zone results in a mass deficiency in the root zone that causes the overlying tephra and the adjacent country rocks to subside passively in a sinkhole-like fashion into the root zone. Many phreatomagmatic eruptions consequently result in the formation of a cone-shaped diatreme. Thus with ongoing eruptions the cone-shaped diatreme has to grow systematically both in depth and diameter. During its growth, processes in the lower diatreme levels successively destroy the upper levels of the evolving root zone. At the surface, the maar crater in turn reacts to the underlying subsidence processes and also grows both in depth and diameter. Thermohydraulic explosions, which fragment both magma and the surrounding country rocks, mostly occur within the bottom part of the root zone. Violent explosions in small pipes may clear the overlying diatreme for a short period of time before tephra fall and collapse of the walls of the new crater refill the small initial diatreme. In larger pipes, via expansion of the mixture of highly pressurized water vapor, juvenile gas phases and explosively produced tephra, the confined and expanding eruption cloud has to pierce through the diatreme fill in a feeder conduit in order to erupt. Diatreme-clearing events in large pipes are difficult or impossible to maintain, since the explosive force in the root zone is only in exceptional instances strong enough to lift or entrain the entire diatreme tephra. Knowledge of the genetic relationships between root zones and diatremes is critical to understand pipe growth processes. The combination of such processes can lead to substantial variation in volcanic behavior and thus produce fundamentally different volcano and rock types. It is the purpose of this paper to outline important features of root zones and suggest their significance for the genesis and evolution of maar-diatreme and related volcanoes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Pyroclastic eruptions of Ngauruhoe volcano on February 19, 1975, were observed closely. A 1.5-hour period of voluminous gas-streaming emission was followed by a series of violently explosive cannon-like eruptions, which threw blocks at least 2.8 km from the vent. Initial ejecta velocities of 400 m s-1 indicate high explosion gas pressures, possibly caused by magmatic intrusions rapidly heating confined meteoric water, the explosions being driven largely by phreatic steam rather than magmatic gases. Pyroclastic avalanches were generated by both the gas-streaming and cannon-like eruptions; in the latter they were formed by collapse of dense eruption columns onto the summit of the volcano. Downslope transport appears to have been by inertial grain flow mechanisms; erosion of chutes and short runout distances indicate that the avalanches were neither highly fluidised nor of air-layer lubricated type. A minimum bulk volume of 3.4 ?? 106m3 of pyroclastic material was erupted. Although of smaller scale, the Ngauruhoe explosions appear to have analogies to the 1968 Arenal and Mayon eruptions. ?? 1978.},

abstract = {The flow in the wake and near-wake regions of individual Taylor bubbles rising through stagnant and co-current vertical columns of Newtonian liquids was studied, employing simultaneously particle image velocimetry (PIV) and pulsed shadowgraphy techniques (PST). Experiments were made with water and aqueous glycerol solutions covering a wide range of viscosities (1 × 10- 3Pa s {\textless} $\mu$ {\textless} 1.5 Pa s), in an acrylic column of 32 mm ID. Different wake structures (laminar, transitional and turbulent) are identified, in both stagnant and co-current flow conditions. In stagnant liquids, the wake flow pattern is only dependent on the dimensionless group Nf. The different types of wakes obtained are in accordance with the critical Nfnumbers proposed in previous works. For co-current flow conditions, the flow patterns in the wake depend on the Reynolds number based on the relative (to the bubble) average velocity of the upward liquid flow, the laminar-transitional and transitional-turbulent limits being for the first time experimentally determined. The wake flow patterns are quantified by means of instantaneous and average flow fields. Values for the wake length and wake volume are also presented and compare well with correlations found in literature. Study of the flow in the near-wake zone enabled determination of the distance needed to recover the undisturbed liquid velocity profile. The detailed study of the flow in the wake and near-wake regions is an important contribution to better understanding the interaction and coalescence mechanisms between Taylor bubbles. The data reported are relevant to the validation of numerical simulation codes in the vertical slug flow regime. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Repetitive explosions of silicic volcanoes are thought to be triggered by volcanic gases in$\backslash$nthe shallow parts of the conduit. To trap the volcanic gases in the conduit, the lava dome$\backslash$nor plug must be impermeable.

Since$\backslash$nfractured magma has high permeability, the reduction of permeability is a key process that$\backslash$nallows gases to accumulate, leading to an explosion. We performed uniaxial compression$\backslash$nexperiments on rhyolite fragments at temperatures of 700–900 °C to investigate the permeability$\backslash$nreduction of fractured rhyolite.

abstract = {Abstract  Fuego volcano, Guatemala is a high (3,800 m) composite volcano that erupts gas-rich, high-Al basalt, often explosively. It spends many years in an essentially open vent condition, but this activity has not been extensively observed or recorded until now. The volcano towers above a region with several tens of thousands of people, so that patterns in its activity might have hazard mitigation applications. We conducted 2 years of continuous observations at Fuego (2005–2007) during which time the activity consisted of minor explosions, persistent degassing, paroxysmal eruptions, and lava flows. Radiant heat output from MODIS correlates well with observed changes in eruptive behavior, particularly during abrupt changes from passive lava effusion to paroxysmal eruptions. A short-period seismometer and two low-frequency microphones installed during the final 6 months of the study period recorded persistent volcanic tremor (1–3 Hz) and a variety of explosive eruptions. The remarkable correlation between seismic tremor, thermal output, and daily observational data defines a pattern of repeating eruptive behavior: 1) passive lava effusion and subordinate strombolian explosions, followed by 2) paroxysmal eruptions that produced sustained eruptive columns, long, rapidly emplaced lava flows, and block and ash flows, and finally 3) periods of discrete degassing explosions with no lava effusion. This study demonstrates the utility of low-cost observations and ground-based and satellite-based remote sensing for identifying changes in volcanic activity in remote regions of underdeveloped countries.},

abstract = {A detailed stratigraphic analysis of the Avellino plinian deposit of the Somma-Vesuvius volcano shows a complicated eruptive sequence controlled by a combination of magmatic and hydromagmatic processes. The role of external water on the eruptive dynamics was most relevant in the very early phase of the eruption when the groundwater explosively interacted with a rising, gas-exolving magma body creating the first conduit. This phase generated pyroclastic surge and phreatoplinian deposits followed by a rapidly increasing discharge of a gas-rich, pure magmatic phase which erupted as the most violent plinian episode. This continuing plinian phase tapped the magma chamber, generating about 2.9 km3 of reverse-graded fallout pumice, more differentiated at the base and more primitive at the top (white and gray pumice). A giant, plinian column, rapidly grew up reaching a maximum height of 36 km. The progressive magma evacuation at a maximum discharge rate of 108 kg/s that accompanied a decrease of magmatic volatile content in the lower primitive magma allowed external water to enter the magma chamber, resulting in a drastic change in the eruptive style and deposit type. Early wet hydromagmatic events were followed by dry ones and only a few, subordinated magmatic phases. A thick, impressive sequence of pyroclastic surge bedsets of over 430 km2 in area with a total volume of about 1 km3 is the visible result of this hydromagmatic phase. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Switching between seismic-only harmonic tremor (SHT) and seismo-acoustic harmonic tremor (SAHT) has been reported at few volcanoes worldwide, but its occurrence may indicate important changes in shallow conduit conditions. Switching was simulated in a laboratory experiment in which harmonic signals were produced with a flow-driven valve and compressed air. The harmonic signals were passed through a tank of shear-thinning viscoelastic fluid, and the resulting signals were recorded. At high fluid stiffness, a stable, open conduit was produced, and the harmonic signals generated within the experimental apparatus were efficiently transmitted into the atmosphere. At lower fluid stiffness, bubbling dominated the activity, stable pathways were not generated in the fluid, and HT was not recorded in the atmosphere. These results are compared to observations of switching at Fuego volcano, Guatemala. We conclude that at intermediate magma viscosities, the development of stable degassing pathways open to the atmosphere will allow HT generated in the conduit to be transmitted into the atmosphere. Further, subtle changes in magma properties and supply rate may control whether SHT or SAHT is recorded, providing information about the state of the shallow conduit and vent at active volcanoes.},

abstract = {Eruptive plume dynamics is a direct expression of explosive style, where duration and altitude of eruptive clouds and dispersion of erupted products is proportional to the degree of fragmentation. We present an analysis of infrasonic and thermal records for explosions at Villarrica (Chile), Stromboli (Italy), Santiaguito and Fuego (Guatemala) volcanoes. Across these four systems magma composition spans from basaltic to dacitic and explosive activity is typically described as ranging from Strombolian to Vulcanian. We use this analysis to provide a quantitative, geophysically-based description of, and discrimination between, the different explosive styles that characterize the four volcanoes. While infrasound is directly related to the emission of over-pressurized gas, and thus solely reflects the plume emission, both plume emission and ascent are detected thermally. Thus, the two data sets together provide a complete description of the plume dynamics. In particular, while infrasound solely reflects the gas-thrust phase driving plume emission, thermal radiation energy is also affected by buoyancy during plume ascent. Thermal radiation energy estimated for explosions at Stromboli and Villarrica (104-107??J) is lower than that for events at Santiaguito and Fuego (108-109??J), but infrasonic energies overlap. This suggests a greater contribution of buoyancy for eruptive clouds at Santiaguito and Fuego when compared with Stromboli and Villarrica. We further investigated the plume dynamics by comparing infrasonic energy, which reflects gas-thrust (EGT), with the difference between thermal radiation and infrasonic energies, which mostly reflects buoyancy (EB). Our data distribution reveals two separate clusters. Explosions at Stromboli and Villarrica share low values of buoyancy, pointing to a gas-thrust dominated emission, efficient coupling of the infrasonic source to the atmosphere, and a Strombolian-type source process to generate a plume rich in coarse fragments. In contrast, explosions at Santiaguito and Fuego share large buoyancy (EB), and are consistent with Vulcanian-type events in which a large part of infrasonic energy is spent in magma fragmentation leading to ascent of buoyant, ash-rich plumes. We demonstrate that the comparison between thermal radiation and infrasonic energies of explosions allows a quantitative discrimination between, and characterization of, Strombolian- and Vulcanian-type explosions, which leads us to suggest that such an approach may be used as an index to further (and quantitatively) discriminate between eruptive styles. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In order to assess the physical mechanisms at stake when giant gas bubbles burst at the top of a magma conduit, laboratory experiments have been performed. An overpressurized gas cavity is initially closed by a thin liquid film, which suddenly bursts. The acoustic signal produced by the bursting is investigated. The key result is that the amplitude and energy of the acoustic signal strongly depend on the film rupture time. As the rupture time is uncontrolled in the experiments and in the field, the measurement of the acoustic excess pressure in the atmosphere, alone, cannot provide any information on the overpressure inside the bubble before explosion. This could explain the low energy partitioning between infrasound, seismic and explosive dynamics often observed on volcanoes.},

abstract = {The overall picture of Mount Etna deformation emerging since a couple of decades of geodetic surveys shows effects of magma accumulation, characterized by inflation/deflation cycle, accompanied by a sliding instability of the southeast flank, whose manifestation is an increase in the horizontal deformation away from the volcano summit. This is a very interesting case to test whether advanced models, taking into account topography, internal structure and frictional rheology, may contribute to a better understanding of the complex interplay among mechanical response, magmatic activity and gravitational load occurring in a volcanic system. Using finite element numerical models we make predictions of surface displacements associated with a simple expansion source and with a dike-like vertical discontinuity. A new methodology is developed to initialize the lithostatic stress field according to the material and geometrical complexities of the models considered. Our results show that, while an amplification of the horizontal displacement can be easily obtained up to a maximum distance of 10 km from the source, we have not been able to find any configuration to extend further this signal. For the case of Mount Etna this suggests that the large horizontal displacements observed in the east flank along the coast cannot be directly related to magma accumulation below the volcano's summit.},

abstract = {We numerically simulate volcanic inflation caused by magma ascent in a shallow conduit at volcanoes which repeatedly erupt, in order to understand the effect of volatile behavior on magma from geodetic data. Considering magma in which the relative velocities between melt and gas bubbles are negligible, we model magma flow in a one-dimensional open conduit with diffusive gas bubble growth. We calculate the ground displacements and tilts caused by spatio-temporal changes of magma pressure in the conduit. Our simulations show that magma without volatiles causes decelerated changes in volcanic inflation. Magma with gas bubble growth inflates the volcano with a constant, or accelerated, rate. Temporal changes of volcanic deformation are also affected by the magma pressure at the bottom of the conduit. When the pressure is small, the displacements and tilts increase in proportion to the 1.5th power of time. This time rate is similar to that predicted from a basic gas bubble growth model. When the pressure equals the lithostatic pressure, the effects of gas bubble growth relatively decrease and the displacements and tilts increase linearly with time.

abstract = {Shear bands in a volcanic conduit are modelled for crystal-rich magma flow using simplified conditions to capture the fundamental behaviour of a natural system. Our simulations begin with magma crystallinity in equilibrium with an applied pressure field and isothermal conditions. The viscosity of the magma is derived using existing empirical equations and is dependent upon temperature, water content and crystallinity. From these initial conduit conditions we utilize the Finite Element Method, using axi-symmetric coordinates, to simulate shear bands via shear localisation. We use the von Mises visco-plasticity model with constant magma shear strength for a first look into the effects of plasticity. The extent of shear bands in the conduit is explored with a numerical model parameterized with values appropriate for Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills Volcano, Montserrat, although the model is generic in nature. Our model simulates shallow (up to approximately 700 m) shear bands that occur within the upper conduit and probably govern the lava extrusion style due to shear boundaries. We also model the change in the over-pressure field within the conduit for flow with and without shear bands. The pressure change can be as large as several MPa at shallow depths in the conduit, which generates a maximum change in the pressure gradient of 10's of kPa/m. The formation of shear bands could therefore provide an alternative or additional mechanism for the inflation/deflation of the volcano flanks as measured by tilt-metres. Shear bands are found to have a significant effect upon the magma ascent rate due to shear-induced flow reducing conduit friction and altering the over-pressure in the upper conduit. Since we do not model frictional controlled slip, only plastic flow, our model calculates the minimum change in extrusion rate due to shear bands. However, extrusion rates can almost double due to the formation of shear bands, which may help suppress volatile loss. Due to the paucity of data and large parameter space available for the magma shear strength our model results can only allow for a qualitative comparison to a natural system at this stage.},

abstract = {In silicic volcanoes, eruptions commonly begin with violent explosive phases and evolve towards a regime of dome formation. This transition is characterized by a decrease of gas volume fraction, which has usually been attributed to chemical gradients in the volcano chamber. Petrological and geochemical studies suggest that this interpretation may be oversimplified. A critical observation is that the eruption rate decreases with time and is markedly smaller during dome growth than during explosive activity. Following Eichelberger et al. [1], we suggest that the transition from explosive activity to dome formation is due to gas loss through permeable conduit walls. Further, in some cases, the same process may be responsible for the transition from the ash fall regime to pyroclastic flows. Both transitions are a direct consequence of a decrease of eruption rate at constant conduit radius. The gas content of lava rising towards the Earth's surface is determined by two competing processes: pressure release leading to gas exsolution and expansion, and gas loss to the country rock. The amount of gas lost is inversely proportional to the eruption rate and proportional to the pressure difference between conduit and country rock. The critical variable is the pressure in the volcano chamber. This pressure steadily decreases with time as the chamber empties, implying a decrease of eruption rate. In turn, this decrease acts to increase the fraction of gas lost to the country rock and hence to reduce the gas content of the erupted material. The model therefore predicts that, with time, the eruption undergoes a transition from explosive to non-explosive conditions. These transitions occur as bifurcations in the evolution of gas volume fraction with height in the conduit. We find that very small pressure fluctuations of the order of one bar in the chamber lead to large changes of gas content at the vent. This suggests that the transitions of eruptive regime are unstable, and provides an explanation for observed alternations between explosive phases and dome formation. With time, such pressure fluctuations occur when the average vesicularity is smaller and may manifest themselves by extrusion events through an existing dome. In Appendix B, we use data on the height of the Montagne Pel??e spine in 1902 and 1903 to show that the pressure driving this eruption decreased by about 2 MPa in a year. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Eruptive activity at Stromboli Volcano was significantly elevated over background levels in May 2001. During 63 h of observation, eight vents produced, on average, 17 explosions/h with an average repose interval of 3 min. During this period, the Stromboli vents exhibited consistent seismic and acoustic signatures, based on cross-correlation cluster analysis. Dendrogram clustering, based on waveform cross-correlation, was used to illustrate the complexity of the near surface plumbing system of Stromboli's multi-vent edifice. Cross-correlations of displacement seismograms produced by explosions at specific craters, such as the Northeast crater (NEC), form dense waveform clusters with correlation coefficients between 0.96 and 0.99, while displacement waveforms from other craters, such as the Southwest crater (SWC), exhibit loose clusters with correlations between 0.88 and 0.96. The inconsistency of SWC events, as compared to the NEC, suggests that the vent system there is more heterogeneous. Cluster linkage distance between the NEC cluster and the Central crater (CC) cluster is shorter than the linkage distance between the NEC and SWC clusters, indicating that NEC and CC are more closely related. Infrasonic observations were used to locate vent explosions confirming that the clusters of events are associated with specific vents or craters. Qualitative analyses of acoustic waveforms from approximately 500 explosions reveal that impulsive acoustic signals were associated with short, mechanically simple ground displacement responses. These events may correspond to the bursting of an individual gas slug. Similar degassing mechanisms from vents in the NEC and the CC show common characteristics in their displacement waveforms. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Strombolian to Plinian activity from Tungurahua Volcano, Ecuador has been recorded by the autonomous infrasound arrays of the Acoustic Surveillance for Hazardous Eruptions (ASHE) project since early 2006. Our studies suggest that acoustic energy release during large eruptions does appear to broadly scale with eruption intensity. This manuscript provides a detailed chronology and characterization of Tungurahua's eruptive activity between 2006 and 2008 and demonstrates the ability to constrain source parameters of significant eruptions, such as onset, duration, and escalation, at regional distances by combining infrasound and remote sensing techniques. The ASHE system in Ecuador automatically detected over 20,000 volcanic explosions at an array 37km from Tungurahua and was successful at notifying the onset, escalation, and cessation of a hazardous February 2008 eruption with a latency of 5min. Elevated infrasonic energy from sustained and intense Tungurahua eruptions correlates well with ash column heights and their lateral extent during the study period. The spectra of these sustained explosive eruptions appear to be recurrent, readily recognizable, and indicative of volcanic jetting and significant atmospheric ash injection. The paroxysmal Plinian phase of the August 2006 eruption produced an ash cloud that extended well into the stratosphere ({\textgreater}24km), coinciding with a shift of the dominant jetting frequency from 0.25Hz to below 0.1Hz, and radiation of over 5??107W of acoustic power. Transient explosions were often marked by minor or no ash release and are presumed to be more gas-rich. A change in the acoustic spectrum of volcanic jetting was also detected in the transition from a sustained to collapsed eruption column at the end of the July 14, 2006 eruption. The jetting spectrum at Tungurahua during a period of sustained pyroclastic density current production changes from a typical double-peaked to a single-peaked spectrum, suggesting remote acoustic monitoring can help ascertain the stability and dynamics of an eruptive column. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Bingham Canyon is one of the world's largest porphyry Cu–Mo–Au deposits and was previously used as an example to emphasize the role of magma mixing and magmatic sulphide saturation in the enhancement of ore fertility of magmatic systems. We analyzed whole rocks, minerals, and silicate melt inclusions (SMI) from the co-genetic, ore-contemporaneous volcanic package (∼38 Ma). As opposed to previous propositions, whole-rock trace element signatures preclude shoshonite–latite genesis via mixing of melanephelinite and trachyte or rhyolite, whereas core to rim compositional profiles of large clinopyroxene phenocrysts suggests the amalgamation of the ore-related magma reservoir by episodic recharge of shoshonitic to latitic magmas with various degrees of differentiation. Major and trace element and Sr and Nd isotopic signatures indicate that the ore-related shoshonite–latite series were generated by low-degree partial melting of an ancient metasomatized mantle source yielding volatile and ore metal rich magmas. Latite and SMI compositions can be reproduced by MELTS modeling assuming 2-step lower and upper crustal fractionation of a primary shoshonite with minimal country rock assimilation. High oxygen fugacities (≈NNO+1) are prevalent as evidenced by olivine-spinel oxybarometry, high SO3in apatite, and anhydrite saturation. The magma could therefore carry significantly more S than would have been possible at more reducing conditions, and the extent of ore metal sequestration by magmatic sulphide saturation was minimal. The SMI data show that the latites were Cu rich, with Cu concentrations in the silicate melt reaching up to 300–400 ppm at about 60 wt{\%} SiO2. The Au and Ag concentrations are also high (1.5–4 and 50–200 ppb, respectively), but show less variation with SiO2. A sudden drop in Cu and S concentrations in the silicate melt at around 65 wt{\%} SiO2in the presence of high Cl, Mo, Ag, and Au shows that the onset of effective metal extraction by fluid exsolution occurred at a relatively late stage of magma evolution. Overall, our results show that fluid exsolution during simple magmatic differentiation of oxidized alkaline magmas is capable of producing giant porphyry Cu deposits.},

abstract = {Characteristics of convective flows produced by buoyancy of small bubbles rising from the horizontal bottom of a thin water layer are investigated with laboratory experiments, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis for steady convection cells. Immediately after the production of bubbles, small plumes of bubble-contained fluid are produced by Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The laboratory experiment suggests that the convective pattern is modified from plumes to cellular convection when the plumes reach the top of the fluid layer. There is a tendency for the aspect ratio of the cell to increase with the bubble flux, and this tendency was confirmed by numerical simulations. The analysis for steady convection cells also derived consistent solutions: a convection cell with too large a horizontal scale cannot be sustained, and the critical scale increases with the flux of the bubbles. The convective patterns in the final stage depend mainly upon the volume flux (F) of the bubbles and the rising velocity (wb) of a bubble in a still fluid. According to the numerical simulation, the steady cellular pattern is obtained only in limited combinations of F and wb. It is also found that the steady organized cellular convection is only sustained in a system without diffusion of the buoyancy. If the buoyancy diffuses across the trajectories of bubbles, the cellular convection eventually disappears. In the final steady state the buoyancy is transported only by the rising velocity of bubbles. In this respect, this convective motion is quite different from B{\'{e}}nard convection where the steady cellular convection is maintained in a diffusive system. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V.},

The minimum total volume of magma degassed during the 27-month period is estimated to be 2.6 x 10(8) m3. This volume is 20 times larger than that of the magma ejected during the 1986 summit eruption. Convective transport of magma through a conduit is proposed as the mechanism that causes degassing from a magma reservoir at several kilometers depth. The magma transport rate is quantitatively evaluated based on two fluid-dynamic models: Poiseuille flow in a concentric double-walled pipe, and ascent of non-degassed magma spheres through a conduit filled with degassed magma. This process is further tested for an andesitic volcano and is concluded to be a common process for volcanoes that discharge excess volatiles.},

abstract = {Previous laboratory experiments investigating the fluid dynamics of replenished magma chambers have been extended to model effects resulting from the release of gas. Turbu- lent transfer of heat between a layer of dense, hot and volatile-rich mafic magma over- lying cooler more evolved magma can lead to crystallization and exsolution of volatiles in the lower layer. Small gas bubbles can cause the bulk density to decrease to that of the upper layer and thus produce sudden overturning and initiate mixing, followed by further exsolution of gas and explosive eruption. These processes have been modelled in the labo- ratory using a chemical reaction between sodium or potassium carbonate and nitric acid to release small bubbles of CO 2. We have investigated both the initial overturning produced by gas release in the lower layer, and the subsequent evolution of gas due to intimate mixing of the two layers. The latter experiments, in which the reactants remained isolated in the two layers until overturning occurred, demonstrated unambiguously that the fluxes of chemical components across the interfaces between convecting layers are very slow com- pared to the flux of heat. This shows that the evolution of layers of magma of different origins and composition can take place nearly independently of each other. The magmas can coexist in the same stratified chamber, until their bulk densities become equal and they mix together. The processes illustrated in these experiments could occur in H20- bearing magmas such as in the calcalkaline association and in CO2-bearing mafic magmas such as in silica undersaturated suites.},

abstract = {Following 198 years of dormancy, a small phreatic eruption started at the summit of Unzen Volcano Mt. Fugen in November 1990. A swarm of volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes had begun below the western flank of the volcano a year before this eruption, and isolated tremor occurred below the summit shortly before it. The focus of VT events had migrated eastward to the summit and became shallower. Following a period of phreatic activity, phreatomagmatic eruptions began in February 1991, became larger with time, and developed into a dacite dome eruption in May 1991 that lasted approximately 4 years. The emergence of the dome followed inflation, demagnetization and a swarm of high-frequency (HF) earthquakes in the crater area. After the dome appeared, activity of the VT earthquakes and the summit HF events was replaced largely by low-frequency (LF) earthquakes. Magma was discharged nearly continuously through the period of dome growth, and the rate decreased roughly with time. The lava dome grew in an unstable form on the shoulder of Mt. Fugen, with repeating partial collapses. The growth was exogenous when the lava effusion rate was high, and endogenous when low. A total of 13 lobes grew as a result of exogenous growth. Vigorous swarms of LF earthquakes occurred just prior to each lobe extrusion. Endogenous growth was accompanied by strong deformation of the crater floor and HF and LF earthquakes. By repeated exogenous and endogenous growth, a large dome was formed over the crater. Pyroclastic flows frequently descended to the northeast, east, and southeast, and their deposits extensively covered the eastern slope and flank of Mt. Fugen. Major pyroclastic flows took place when the lava effusion rate was high. Small vulcanian explosions were limited in the initial stage of dome growth. One of them occurred following collapse of the dome. The total volume of magma erupted was 2.1 x 10{\^{}}8 m (dense-rock-equivalent); about a half of this volume remained as a lava dome at the summit (1.2 km long, 0.8 km wide and 230–540 m high). The eruption finished with extrusion of a spine at the endogenous dome top. Several monitoring results convinced us that the eruption had come to an end: the minimal levels of both seismicity and rockfalls, no discharge of magma, the minimal SO2 flux, and cessation of subsidence of the western flank of the volcano. The dome 2 started slow deformation and cooling after the halt of magma effusion in February 1995.},

abstract = {Lava lakes, consisting of molten degassing lava in summit craters of active basaltic volcanoes, sometimes exhibit complex cycles of filling and emptying on time-scales of hours to weeks such as recorded at Pu'u'O'o in Hawaii and Oldoinyo Lengai in Tanzania. Here we report on a new series of analogue laboratory experiments of two-phase flow in a reservoir-conduit-lava lake system which spontaneously generates oscillations in the depth of liquid within the lake. During the recharge phase, gas supplied from a subsurface reservoir of degassing magma drives liquid magma up the conduit, causing the lake to fill. As the magmastatic pressure in the lake increases, the upward supply of magma, driven by the gas bubbles, falls. Eventually the upflow becomes unstable, and liquid drains downwards from the lake, driven by the magmastatic pressure of the overlying lake, suppressing the ascent of any more bubbles from the chamber. At a later stage, once the lake has drained sufficiently, the descent speed of liquid through the conduit decreases below the ascent speed of the bubbles, and the recharge cycle resumes. Application of a quantitative model of the experiments to the natural system is broadly consistent with field data.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of dykes in the Earth's crust is evidence that the transport of magma by fluid- induced fracture of the lithosphere is an important phenomenon. Magma fracture transports melt vertically from regions of production in the mantle to surface eruptions or near-surface magma chambers and then laterally from the magma chambers in dykes and sills. In order to investigate the mechanics of magma fracture, the driving and resisting pressures in a propagating dyke are estimated and the dominant physical balances between these pressures are described. It is shown that the transport of magma in feeder dykes is characterized by a local balance between buoyancy forces and viscous pressure drop, that elastic forces play a secondary role except near the dyke tip and that the influence of the fracture resistance of crustal rocks on dyke propagation is negligible. The local nature of the force balance implies that the local density difference controls the height of magma ascent rather than the total hydrostatic head and hence that magma is eraplaced at its level of neutral buoyancy (LNB) in the crust. There is a small overshoot beyond this level which is calculated to be typically a few kilometres. Magma accumulating at the LNB will be intruded in lateral dykes and sills which are directed along the LNB by buoyancy forces since the magma is in gravitational equilibrium at this level. Laboratory analogue experiments demonstrate the physical principle of buoyancy-controlled propagation to and along the LNB. The equations governing the dynamics of magma fracture are solved for the cases of lithospheric ascent and of lateral intrusion. Volattics are predicted to be exsolved from the melt at the tips of extending fractures due to the generation of low pressures by viscous flow into the tip. Chilling of magma at the edges of a dyke inhibits cross-stream propagation and concentrates the downstream flow into a wider dyke. The family of theoretical solutions in different geometries provides simple models which describe the relation between the elastic and fitfid-mechanical phenomena and from which the lengths, widths and rates of propagation can be calculated. The predicted dimensions are in broad agreement with geological observations. 1.},

Model results for the well-documented 1997 Vulcanian explosions at Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills volcano were compared against subsurface conditions constrained by geophysical and petrologic analysis. We suggest that, if magma is permeable and overpressured and rock surrounding the conduit is permeable, degassing occurs both vertically and through conduit walls. This outgassing creates a region of low-vesicularity, dense magma near the surface (magma plug) which eventually seals the conduit and promotes system overpressure. Driving pressure increases with increasing magma flow rate, hindering volatile exsolution and shifting open-system degassing to shallower levels of the conduit. As a result, increasing magma flow rate for a fixed conduit width creates a vertically thinner plug and increases the magnitude and vertical extent of conduit overpressure. Plug thickness and density are also controlled by magma and edifice permeability.},

abstract = {The development of overpressured fluids during soft sediment deformation and compaction can be illustrated using an analogue experiment, which is a simple, inexpensive and reusable teaching tool. Sand, mud and water are shaken in a plastic bottle. When the sediments settle and the water has cleared, the sand supports a layer of mud. Gentle squeezing of the bottle causes the sand to pack more closely and liquefy. Water is expelled from the sand, and becomes trapped beneath, and therefore supports, the mud layer. The pressure in the water beneath the mud changes from hydrostatic to hydrostatic plus the pressure exerted by the weight of the mud layer, i.e. it becomes overpressured. The overpressured water causes blistering and eventual cracking of the mud layer, with a plume of muddy water rising from the blister. The muddy water from the plume sinks because it is denser than the clear water. The mud layer also eventually sinks to become supported by the sand, and hydrostatic pressure is restored to the water column. Natural examples that are the result of this behavior include sub-horizontal calcite veins, clastic sills, and mud- and sand- volcanoes.},

abstract = {Microlite characteristics have been successfully used as indicators of magma decompression rate. However, microlites do not record the explosive-effusive transitions in sub-Plinian eruptions, when such transitions are governed by the decrease of exsolved volatile pressure in the shallow conduit rather than by the magma ascent rate. To overcome this limitation, we studied the nanolites in the quenched products of the 2011 Shinmoedake (Japan) eruption. Nanolites are nanometer-scale components of the groundmass minerals and exhibit a steeper slope of crystal size distribution than that of microlites. In the 2011 eruption, the style of activity had undergone transformation from sub-Plinian eruption to Vulcanian explosion and intermittent effusion of lava. We found that, although the products formed by different eruptive activities have similar microlite characteristics, such products can be distinguished clearly by their mineral assemblage of nanolites. The samples of pumice of sub-Plinian eruptions and Vulcanian explosions and the dense juvenile fragments of lava (in descending order of explosivity) contained, respectively, nanolites of low-Ca pyroxene, low-Ca pyroxene + plagioclase, and low-Ca pyroxene + plagioclase + Fe-Ti oxides. Nanolites crystallize when undercooling of the magma due primarily to dehydration increases rapidly near the surface. The water contents of the interstitial glass indicate that the quenched depths did not differ greatly between eruption styles. Hence, the different nanolite assemblages of each eruption style are assumed to have resulted from differences in magma residence time near the surface. Therefore, we propose that nanolites have the potential to indicate the physicochemical conditions of magma at the transition points of eruption styles. {\textcopyright} 2014 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The {\"{O}}skjuvatn caldera at Askja volcano, North Iceland, was formed as a result of an explosive eruption at Askja on 28th-29th March 1875. {\"{O}}skjuvatn is one of the youngest collapse calderas on Earth, and its initiation and growth were observed and documented by explorers and geologists working in the Askja region between 1875 and 1932. It is an example of caldera formation where the volume of the caldera collapse far exceeds the volume of associated erupted products. The discrepancy between the collapse volume and associated erupted products has been used by previous workers as a justification for the hypothesis that the injection of lateral dykes from Askja fed the February to October 1875 N{\'{y}}jahraun fissure eruptions at the Sveinagj{\'{a}} graben, some 60. km north of Askja. However, historical accounts documenting the caldera formation in sufficient detail show clearly that {\"{O}}skjuvatn formed by piecemeal collapse, taking over 40. years to reach its current form. We use these accounts to undertake a detailed examination of the stages of caldera collapse and to compare them with the known magmatic output of Askja in the years following the 1875 eruption. ArcGIS software was used to calculate the volume of {\"{O}}skjuvatn during the various stages of collapse, and the volume of material erupted after 1875. While a dyke extending between Askja and Sveinagj{\'{a}} may be implied to account for the 'missing' volume, our results demonstrate that the volume of {\"{O}}skjuvatn in July 1875 closely corresponds to the volume of rhyolitic material erupted on 28th-29th March 1875. In addition, geochemical evidence indicates that the N{\'{y}}jahraun magmas were sourced from a deeper reservoir rather than by lateral injection from Askja's shallow crustal magma chamber. We therefore suggest that the injection of sills and dykes in a coherent intrusion complex beneath Askja central volcano, combined with background deflation of the magma storage zone beneath {\"{O}}skjuvatn caldera over 30 to 40. years following 1875, satisfactorily accommodates the volume required to form {\"{O}}skjuvatn caldera. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {The ongoing activity of Mount St. Helens provides an opportunity to study the infrasonic wavefield produced by an active, silica-rich volcano. In late October 2004, as a pilot experiment for the Acoustic Surveillance for Hazardous Eruptions (ASHE) project, we deployed two infrasound arrays, each co-located with a broadband seismometer and weather station, to continuously record seismo-acoustic signals from Mount St. Helens. The nearest array, Coldwater, was deployed on the northern flank of the volcano, ∼ 13 km from the summit. The second array, Sacajawea, was deployed ∼ 250 km east of the volcano, at a distance where stratospherically ducted acoustic waves may be expected during the winter. This paper presents an overview of the experimental setup, and preliminary results from this unique data set. Eruptions on January 16th 2005 and March 9th 2005 produced strong infrasonic signals. The aseismic January 16th eruption signal lasted ∼ 9.4 min beginning at ∼ 11:20:44 01/16/05 UTC, while the March 9th eruption signal lasted ∼ 52.8 min beginning at ∼ 01:26:17 03/09/05 UTC, with the main steam and ash venting stage probably lasting ∼ 7.2 min. The March 9th signal was an order of magnitude larger than the January 16th signal, and was clearly recorded 250 km east at the Sacajawea array. Infrasonic expressions of long period (LP) seismic events ('drumbeats') have also been intermittently observed, and are recorded as acoustic waves mimicking the waveform and temporal sequence of their seismic counterparts. These acoustic observations provide important constraints for source models of long period events and eruptions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Squeeze flow between parallel plates of a purely viscous material is considered for small gaps both for a Newtonian and power law fluid with partial wall slip. The results for the squeeze force as a function of the squeezing speed reduce to the Stefan and Scott equations in the no slip limit, respectively. The slip velocity at the plate increases linearly with the radius up to the rim slip velocity v(s). For small gaps H, the resulting apparent Newtonian rim shear rate-measured for a constant rim shear stress, i.e. an imposed force increasing proportional to 1/H-yields a straight line if plotted versus 1/H. The slope of the straight line is equal to 6 v(s), whereas the intersect with the ordinate yields the effective Newtonian rim shear rate to be converted into the true rim shear rate by means of the power law exponent. The advantage of the new technique is the separation of bulk shear and wall slip from a single test. A more general derivation for the Newtonian case being also valid for full lubrication and large gaps is used to explain the gap dependence of the squeeze modulus of an elastic material.},

abstract = {Using high frame rate (33Hz) thermal video data we describe and parameterize the emission and ascent dynamics of a mixed plume of gas and particles emitted during a normal explosion at Stromboli (Aeolian Islands, Italy). Analysis of 34 events showed that 31 of them were characterized by a first phase characterized by an initial diffuse spray of relatively small (lapilli-sized) particles moving at high velocities (up to 213ms -1; average 66-82ms -1). This was followed, typically within 0.1s, by a burst comprising a mixture of ash and lapilli, but dominated by larger bomb-sized particles, moving at lower exit velocities of up to 129ms -1, but typically 46ms -1. We interpret these results as revealing initial emission of a previously unrecorded high velocity gas-jet phase, to which the lapilli are coupled. This is followed by emission of slower moving larger particles that are decoupled from the faster moving gas-phase. Diameters for particles carried by the gas phase are typically around 4cm, but can be up to 9cm, with the diameter of the particles carried by the gas jet (D) decreasing with increased density and velocity of the erupted gas cloud (?? gas and U gas). Data for 101 particles identified as moving with the gas jet during 32 eruptions allow us to define a new relation, whereby U gas=U particle+a [?? gas D] b. Here, U particle is the velocity of bombs whose motion is decoupled from that of the gas cloud, and a and b are two empirically-derived coefficients. This replaces the old relation, whereby U gas=U particle+k D; a relation that requires a constant gas density for each eruption. This is an assumption that we show to be invalid, with gas density potentially varying between 0.04kgm -3 and 9kgm -3 for the 32 cases considered, so that k varies between 54m 1/2s -1 and 828m 1/2s -1, compared with the traditionally used constant of 150m 1/2s -1. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Caldera-forming volcanic eruptions are low-frequency, high-impact events capable of discharging tens to thousands of cubic kilometres of magma explosively on timescales of hours to days, with devastating effects on local and global scales. Because no such eruption has been monitored during its long build-up phase, the precursor phenomena are not well understood. Geophysical signals obtained during recent episodes of unrest at calderas such as Yellowstone, USA, and Campi Flegrei, Italy, are difficult to interpret, and the conditions necessary for large eruptions are poorly constrained. Here we present a study of pre-eruptive magmatic processes and their timescales using chemically zoned crystals from the 'Minoan' caldera-forming eruption of Santorini volcano, Greece, which occurred in the late 1600s BC. The results provide insights into how rapidly large silicic systems may pass from a quiescent state to one on the edge of eruption. Despite the large volume of erupted magma (40-60 cubic kilometres), and the 18,000-year gestation period between the Minoan eruption and the previous major eruption, most crystals in the Minoan magma record processes that occurred less than about 100 years before the eruption. Recharge of the magma reservoir by large volumes of silicic magma (and some mafic magma) occurred during the century before eruption, and mixing between different silicic magma batches was still taking place during the final months. Final assembly of large silicic magma reservoirs may occur on timescales that are geologically very short by comparison with the preceding repose period, with major growth phases immediately before eruption. These observations have implications for the monitoring of long-dormant, but potentially active, caldera systems.},

abstract = {The evaluation of the intensity of unrest phases at active volcanoes is a crucial topic in volcano hazard studies. This is particularly troublesome in the case of persistently active volcanoes like Stromboli (Southern Italy), where intense eruptive summit activity (overflows, strong spattering, powerful explosions) has in some cases anticipated a flank eruption. In this context, a new approach for the analysis of displacement data is introduced. Daily displacements of the Stromboli crater terrace measured between January 1, 2010, and August 7, 2014, by a ground-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar system were compared, in retrospect, to displacement predictions provided by an auto-regressive integrated moving average-based model. The methodology consisted in assessing when the actual displacements exceeded a fixed probability threshold for the forecasts ({\~{}}95 {\%}). Two sets of data were consequently produced: (1) series of residuals between actual displacements and model threshold (“anomalies”) and (2) series of normalized residuals between actual displacements and model threshold (“normalized anomalies”). This permitted to statistically identify and quantify the anomalous deformation at the crater terrace over the reference time interval of the analysis. Anomalies started to occur before each period of intense volcanic activity, highlighting the possibility to discern between background activity and unrest. Moreover, results indicated that the inflation of the crater terrace during the preparatory phase of the 2014 flank eruption was characterized by the greatest amount of anomalous deformation.},

abstract = {The flow dynamics of magmas is controlled by several parameters, including magma rheology, density, surface tension, gas and liquid flow rate, and the geometry of the flow field, which is mainly regulated by the conduit shape. For this reason, magmatic flows along fis-sures and dikes are significantly different from those along axisymmetric conduits. Basaltic eruptions are typically fed by fractures or dike systems that reach the surface, giving rise to fissure eruptions. Scaled experiments show that in these low-viscosity systems, gas transport and segregation (i.e., the outgassing dynamics) are deeply controlled by the fracture geometry. Rapid bubble clustering and formation of bubble plumes determine the formation of lateral magma convection cells involving up to 70 vol{\%} of the melt. In analogy with outgassing in cylindrical conduits, the average vesicularity and size of bubbles increase with increasing gas flow rate and melt viscosity and density, which also control the lateral extent of the bubble plume and convection cells.},

abstract = {In order to understand the role of the subducted lithosphere in producing the geochemical characteristics of arc magmas, major- and trace-element along with Sr- and Nd-isotope compositions have been determined for Quaternary volcanic rocks from the Izu-Bonin intra-oceanic arc. 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd ratios decrease away from the volcanic front of this arc and lie on mixing lines between the assumed isotopic compositions of fluid phases mainly derived from the basalt layer of the subducted lithosphere and upper-mantle materials in the sub-arc wedge. This across-arc variation can be explained through a simple sequence of processes involving initial release of fluid phases from the subducted oceanic crust to produce hydrous peridotite at the base of the mantle wedge. This hydrous peridotite is dragged downward with the slab and releases a second-stage metasomatizing fluid beneath the volcanic arc. The higher concentrations of both Sr and Nd in the fluid beneath the volcanic front than those beneath the back-arc side may be a possible cause of the observed across-arc variation in Sr-Nd isotopic ratios. The difference in compositions of fluid phases is attributed to the different hydrous phases which decompose in the hydrous peridotite layer; amphibole beneath the volcanic front and phlogopite beneath the back-arc side of the volcanic arc. The mineralogically controlled fluid addition may also be responsible for the across-arc variation in Rb/K and Rb/Zr ratios, increasing away from the volcanic front. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Most volcanic eruptions occur in craters formed by previous activity. The presence of a crater implies specific confinement geometries, variably filled by loose fragmental deposits, which are expected to exert a strong, yet poorly studied, control on the violent gas expansion that drives the eruption. Here we analyze patterns of ejection from buried explosions in analog experiments, in order to investigate how the presence of a crater and changes in explosion depth and intensity may affect the formation of eruptive ejecta jets. Results show that scaled depth (charge burial depth divided by the cubic root of charge energy) controls the velocity and, partly, spread angle of eruptive jets independently of the presence of a pre-existing crater. Conversely, for a fixed scaled depth, the presence of a pre-existing crater limits the development of a laterally expanding annulus of the jet. These results are directly applicable to interpretation of volcanic explosions.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the rise and expansion of a gas slug as a fluid dynamic source mechanism for infrasonic signals generated by gas puffing and impulsive explosions at Stromboli. The fluid dynamics behind the rise, expansion and burst of gas slugs in the confines of an experimental tube can be characterised into different regimes. Passive expansion occurs for small gas masses, where negligible dynamic gas over-pressure develops during bubble ascent and, prior to burst, meniscus oscillation forms an important infrasonic source. With increasing gas mass, a transition regime emerges where dynamic gas over-pressure is significant. For larger gas masses, this regime transforms to fully explosive behaviour, where gas over-pressure dominates as an infrasonic source and bubble bursting is not a critical factor. The rate of change of excess pressure in the experimental tube was used to generate synthetic infrasonic waveforms. Qualitatively, the waveforms compare well to infrasonic waveforms measured from a range of eruptions at Stromboli. Assuming pressure continuity during flow through the vent, and applying dimensionless arguments from the first-order experiments, allows estimation of eruption metrics from infrasonic signals measured at Stromboli. Values of bubble length, gas mass and over-pressure calculated from infrasonic signals are in excellent agreement with those derived by independent means for eruptions at Stromboli, therefore providing a method of estimating eruption metrics from infrasonic measurement. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

@article{Klug1996,
abstract = {Fragmentation, or the "coming apart" of magma during a plinian eruption, remains one of the least understood processes in volcanology, although assumptions about the timing and mechanisms of fragmentation are key parameters in all existing eruption models. Despite evidence to the contrary, most models assume that fragmentation occurs at a critical vesicularity (volume percent vesicles) of 75–83{\%}. We propose instead that the degree to which magma is fragmented is determined by factors controlling bubble coalescence: magma viscosity, temperature, bubble size distribution, bubble shapes, and time. Bubble coalescence in vesiculating magmas creates permeability which serves to connect the dispersed gas phase. When sufficiently developed, permeability allows subsequent exsolved and expanded gas to escape, thus preserving a sufficiently interconnected region of vesicular magma as a pumice clast, rather than fully fragmenting it to ash. For this reason pumice is likely to preserve information about (a) how permeability develops and (b) the critical permeability needed to insure clast preservation. We present measurements and calculations that constrain the conditions (vesicularity, bubble size distribution, time, pressure difference, viscosity) necessary for adequate permeability to develop. We suggest that magma fragments explosively to ash when and where, in a heterogeneously vesiculating magma, these conditions are not met. Both the development of permeability by bubble wall thinning and rupture and the loss of gas through a permeable network of bubbles require time, consistent with the observation that degree of fragmentation (i.e., amount of ash) increases with increasing eruption rate.},

abstract = {1Explosive activity at Stromboli volcano is analyzed using a high-frame rate (50 Hz) thermal camera and differential pressure transducers. We develop a thermal image-based decomposition method to derive vertical and horizontal exit velocities of the explosive cloud. Peak vertical velocity ranges between 23 and 203 m/s, slightly higher than previous estimates and rapidly decreasing to a constant value of 30-50 m/s within the first ∼0.1 s. Plume velocities are consistent with an elongated cloud expanding much faster vertically than horizontally and indicating the interaction with the conduit wall. Considering a vent radius of ∼2 m we estimate a volumetric flux of 200-600 m/s, which converts to total volumes of gas-particles of 10-10 m for a single eruption. These volumes are proportional to the thermal energy recorded by the camera, providing a means to convert thermal radiance to volumes. Comparing the thermal onset of the explosions with the arrival time of the acoustic pressure, we demonstrate that infrasound is propagating 0.14 - 1.7 s ahead of the explosive front. The time difference between thermal and acoustic onsets constrains the infrasonic source within the conduit at 15-35 m below the crater rim. Peak amplitudes of acoustic pressure show a power law relationship (p ∼ U {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) with the exit vertical velocities consistent with the energy balance of a two-phase flow rapidly accelerated in the conduit by gas decompression. Our results support monopole isotropic acoustic radiation of a source embedded within the conduit walls and indicate that explosive dynamics undergo strong accelerations of 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} m/s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. {\textcopyright} 2012.

Here we identify the locations and characterize three distinct sources of local infrasound, including two types of infrasonic sources, which are not commonly discussed in the literature. The first of these novel sources is an intense and continuous radiator with a fixed location corresponding to San Rafael Waterfall. The signal from the river exhibits a tremor-like envelope that is well correlated across the 3-element infrasound network. Beyond the river, we also observe and map spatially variable sources corresponding to thunder. These transient signals have impulsive onsets, but are not well correlated across the network and are attributable to spatially-distributed source regions. Finally, we identify plentiful infrasound corresponding to Reventador's volcanic vent that is associated with unrest. This study demonstrates the utility of dispersed infrasound networks for distinguishing variable sources and improving interpretation of mechanisms of infrasound radiators.},

abstract = {Lava fountains are spectacular continuous gas jets, propelling lava fragments to heights of several hundred metres, which occasionally occur during eruptions of low-viscosity magmas. Whether they are generated by the effervescent disruption of fast-rising bubbly melt or by the separate ascent of a bubble foam layer accumulated at depth still remains a matter of debate. No field measurement has yet allowed firm discrimination between these two models. A key insight into the origin of lava fountains may be gained by measuring the chemical composition of the driving gas phase. This composition should differ markedly depending on whether the magma degassing occurs before or during eruption. Here we report the analysis of magmatic gas during a powerful (250-600 m high) lava fountain, measured with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on Mount Etna, Sicily. The abundances of volcanic gas species, determined from absorption spectra of lava radiation, reveal a fountain gas having higher CO2/S and S/Cl ratios than other etnean emissions, and which cannot derive from syn-eruptive bulk degassing of Etna basalt. Instead, its composition suggests violent emptying of a gas bubble layer previously accumulated at about 1.5 km depth below the erupting crater.},

abstract = {During the eruption of the Soufriere Hills volcano, Montserrat (1995-99), and several other dome eruptions, shallow seismicity, short-lived explosive eruptions and ground deformation patterns indicating large overpressures (of several megapascals) in the uppermost few hundred metres of the volcanic conduit have been observed. These phenomena can be explained by the nonlinear effects of crystallization and gas loss by permeable flow, which are here incorporated into a numerical model of conduit Row and lava dome extrusion. Crystallization can introduce strong feedback mechanisms which greatly amplify the effect on extrusion rates of small changes of chamber pressure, conduit dimensions or magma viscosity. When timescales for magma ascent are comparable to timescales for crystallization, there can be multiple steady solutions for fixed conditions. Such nonlinear dynamics can cause large changes in dome extrusion rate and pulsatory patterns of dome growth.},

abstract = {Thebubble drag and lift coefficients, CDand CL, are of great importance in the numerical prediction of bubbly flows based on multi-fluid models [1], [2] and bubble tracking methods [3]-[7]. Though a number of studies on CD and CL have been carried out so far [8], [9], our knowledgeon them is still insufficient even for single bubbles in stagnant liquids and in simple shear flows for lack of relevant experimental data such as the terminal velocities of single bubbles in various stagnant liquids and the lateral migration of single bubbles in viscous linear shear flows. In my laboratory, several fundamental experiments on single bubbles have therefore been conducted, such as measurements of (1) shapes and motions of single bubbles in various infinite stagnant liquids [10]-[12], (2) shapes and motions of single bubbles in various conduits [13]-[15], (3) lateral migration of single bubbles in linear shear flows of various liquids [12], [16], and (4) lateral migration of single bubbles due to the presence of wall [17]. Theoretical and numerical works to develop reliable closure relations have been also carried out along with the experimental works [10], [12], [15]. This report reviews recent studies on single bubbles carried out in my laboratory. In section 2, the necessary and sufficient condition of dynamical similarity for a single bubble will be deduced from the local instantaneous field equations to make clear the forces acting on a bubble and relevant dimensionless groups for modeling the terminal velocity and drag coefficient. Then a theoretical terminal velocity model for oblate and prolate spheroidal bubbles will be deduced from the local instantaneous equations and jump conditions in section 3. The lack of uniqueness in terminal velocity caused by a certain kind of nonlinear bifurcationof terminal condition will be discussed in section 4. Then the effects of fluid properties, bubble sizes and shear rates on the lift coefficients of single bubbles in viscous linear shear flows will be discussed in section 5.},

abstract = {Density heterogeneities in the mantle influence the dynamics of mantle upwellings and therefore modify plume characteristics. Using analog laboratory experiments, we explore the dynamics of “thermo-chemical” plumes containing both thermal and chemical density anomalies inherited from a stratified boundary layer at the base of the mantle. Because all plumes cool by thermal diffusion as they rise, a chemically composite thermal plume will eventually attain a level of neutral buoyancy, at which it will begin to “fail”. Separation within the plume will occur, whereby the chemically denser material will start to sink back while the heated surrounding mantle keeps rising. It more generally implies that 1) mantle plumes are not necessarily narrow and continuous throughout the mantle but can be fat and patchy such as Iceland, 2) a hot mantle region may not be buoyant and rising, but on contrary may be sinking, and 3) mantle plumes dynamics are strongly time-dependent.},

abstract = {In late 2008 we recorded a continuous multi-parameter data set including Doppler radar, infrared and infrasound data at Yasur volcano, Vanuatu. Our recordings cover a transition in explosive style from ash-rich to ash-free explosions followed again by a phase of high ash discharge. To assess the present paradigm of Strombolian behavior in this study we investigate the geophysical signature of these different explosive episodes and compare our results to observations at Stromboli volcano, Italy. To this end we characterize Yasur's surface activity in terms of material movement, temperature and excess pressure. The joint temporal trend in these data reveals smooth variations of surface activity and regime-like persistence of individual explosion forms over days. Analysis of all data types shows ash-free and ash-rich explosive styles similar to those found at Stromboli volcano. During ash-free activity low echo powers, high explosion velocities and high temperatures result from the movement of isolated hot ballistic clasts. In contrast, ash-rich episodes exhibit high echo powers, low explosion velocities and low temperatures linked to the presence of colder ash-rich plumes. Furthermore ash-free explosions cause high excess pressure signals exhibiting high frequencies opposed to low-amplitude, low-frequency signals accompanying ash-rich activity. To corroborate these findings we compare fifteen representative explosions of each explosive episode. Explosion onset velocities derived from Doppler radar and infrared camera data are in excellent agreement and consistent with overall observations in each regime. Examination of infrasound recordings likewise confirms our observations, although a weak coupling between explosion velocity and excess pressure indicates changes in wave propagation. The overall trend in explosion velocity and excess pressure however demonstrates a general correlation between explosive style and explosion intensity, and points to stability of the uppermost conduit on timescales shorter than at Stromboli volcano.},

abstract = {Volcanic events comprising multiple eruptive stages are common in the historical and geological record and display activity of variable intensity ranging, in some cases, through to several centuries. To better understand the characteristics of such events globally, this study explores a database of historical events having Volcanic Explosivity Indices 4 or greater. The database was compiled for the most part from published and unpublished material provided by the Smithsonian Institution. The database was examined to find common statistical relationships, within and between the variables characterising multi-stage explosive events. In concert with common usage, an event is defined here as clearly related activity over days to years whereas a stage represents a shorter duration (hours to weeks) characterised by one distinct style of activity. Over half of all volcanic events investigated exhibited more than one explosive stage and 77{\%} of these stages occurred within the first 10{\%} of the total defined duration of the event. This investigation confirmed a general eruptive pattern of declining explosivity with time and reaffirmed a positive correlation between stage column height and volume. Distributions presented in this paper are a first step towards describing the general patterns displayed by multi-stage events; however, it must be cautioned that they may be applicable neither for any particular volcanic centre nor across all eruptive scales and styles.},

abstract = {Bubble coalescence and the spontaneous disruption of high-porosity foams in silicate melts are the result of physical expulsion of interpore melt (syneresis) leading to bubble coalescence, and diffusive gas exchange between bubbles. Melt expulsion can be achieved either along films between pairs of bubbles, or along Plateau borders which represent the contacts between 3 or more bubbles. Theoretical evaluation of these mechanisms is confirmed by experimental results, enabling us to quantify the relevant parameters and determine stable bubble size and critical film thickness in a foam as a function of melt viscosity, surface tension, and time. Foam stability is controlled primarily by melt viscosity and time. Melt transport leading to coalescence of bubbles proceeds along inter-bubble films for smaller bubbles, and along Plateau borders for larger bubbles. Thus the average bubble size accelerates with time. In silicate melts, the diffusive gas expulsion out of a region of foam is effective only for water (and even then, only at small length scales), as the diffusion of CO2 is negligible. The results of our analyses are applicable to studies of vesicularity of lavas, melt degassing, and eruption mechanisms.},

The seismic network, which consists at present of four vertical stations and one three-component station, recorded an increase in earthquake activity in 1978 and between November 1988 and March 1989. During the later activity, earthquakes were located in a cluster about 3 km beneath the summit of the volcano. Two tide gauges, two tiltmeters and a recording gravimeter are also operating at Somma-Vesuvio. Yearly levelling surveys are conducted along several closed routes that extend from as much as 6 km from the base of the volcano to the summit area. Survey results reveal no significant ground movement since 1959, except for a slight subsidence around the rim of the summit crater. Gravity changes have been larger than the expected 10 ??Gal uncertainty of the measurements. The lack of contemporary elevation changes implies that the observed gravity changes are the result of a slight change in density structure. The cone of Somma-Vesuvio has been very stable for the last few decades, showing no indications of a buildup to activity. The lack of surface movement should rule out a magma-supply rate to this volcano at the historic eruptive rate of 0.002 km3/yr. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {We herein propose a three-pressure-source model for ground inflation with highly eruptive activity at the Showa crater of Sakurajima volcano, Japan. We applied a model of stacked spherical sources to continuous combined geodetic data from a global navigation satellite system, tilt and strainmeters. The data were recorded during ground inflation throughout an eruptive episode that began in October 2011 and ended in March 2012. Using a genetic algorithm, we obtained the locations and volumes of three sources. A pressure source analysis of ground inflation during the period from October 2011 to March 2012 revealed inflation sources to be located at a depth of 9.6 km beneath Aira caldera (A-source) and 3.3 km beneath Kita-dake (K-source), and a shallow deflation source is located at a depth of 0.7 km beneath Minami-dake (M-source). The A-source corresponds to the main magma reservoir at a depth of 10 km beneath the Aira caldera inferred by previous geophysical studies. The K-source is a-reservoir of Sakurajima volcano, where magma intrudes from the main magma reservoir beneath the Aira caldera during the first stage of eruptive activity. The M-source is the uppermost part of a conduit from the K-source to the summit and the Showa crater. Magma injection into the A-source started in mid-November 2011, instantly triggering the migration of increased volumes of magma from the A-source to the K-source. Approximately one month later, in mid-December 2011, an increased volume of magma started migrating from the K-source to the M-source and finally erupted at the surface. The accumulation rate for the A-source is comparable to the magma supply rate for the past 100 years (0.8 to 1.6 × 107m3). The three-pressure-source model was applied to inflation events before the 2011 event in order to reconstruct the magma migration process. Applying our source model to earlier activity phases, we found that injected magma from the A-source remained at the K-source and a small amount of magma began to move from the K-source to the M-source before the start of eruptive activity at the Showa crater in June 2006; furthermore, a large amount of magma was found to have moved toward the crater during this violent volcanic activity. We also found that the magma injection rate into the A-source sometimes reached the level of the average injection rate of the past 100 years during the ground inflation events.},

abstract = {Results from chemical and isotopic analyses of water and gas collected between 2002 and 2016 from sites on and around Mount St. Helens are used to assess magmatic degassing related to the 2004-2008 eruption. During 2005 the chemistry of hot springs in The Breach of Mount St. Helens showed no obvious response to the eruption, and over the next few years, changes were subtle, giving only slight indications of perturbations in the system. By 2010 however, water chemistry, temperatures, and isotope compositions ($\delta$D and $\delta$18O) clearly indicated some inputs of volatiles and heat associated with the eruption, but the changes were such that they could be attributed to a pre-existing, gas depleted magma. An increase of {\~{}}1.5‰ in the $\delta$13C values of dissolved carbon in the springs was noted in 2006 and continued through 2009, a change that was mirrored by a similar shift in $\delta$13C-CO2 in bubble gas emissions. These changes require input of a new source of carbon to the hydrothermal system and provide clear evidence of CO2 from an undegassed body of magma. Rising trends in 3He/4He ratios in gas also accompanied the increases in $\delta$13C. Since 2011 maximum RC/RA values are ≥6.4 and are distinctly higher than 5 samples collected between 1986 and 2002, and provide additional evidence for some involvement of new magma as early as 2006, and possibly earlier, given the unknown time needed for CO2 and He to traverse the system and arrive at the springs.},

abstract = {Fragmentation experiments and detailed textural studies were performed on Vulcanian pyroclasts of variable porosity from Soufrire Hills volcano, Montserrat. We use textural differences to identify two types of pyroclasts with distinct eruption histories. Our experiments show that high-porosity Type 1 pumice fragments rapidly, and that low-porosity Type 2 fragments relatively slowly. Both types of pyroclast contain fractured crystals containing burst melt inclusions. The orientations of the fractures relative to the crystal alignment indicate that Type 1 decompressed vertically and Type 2 decompressed laterally. We interpret that Type 1 clasts were derived from the conduit center, whereas Type 2 clasts were derived from the implosion of the conduit lining. We propose a conceptual model of rapid fragmentation of pumice in the conduit center, and a slower fragmentation of a pressurized conduit wall, vulnerable to implosion. Conduit implosion can explain observed widening of volcanic vents during eruptions. We also hypothesize that the fragmentation front is concave; this has important implications for modeling of explosive eruptions.},

Since the violent explosive eruption of 1631, the volcano has been in persistent activity, rebuilding the morphology that it had before that eruption. A succession of explosive and effusive eruptions occurred until 1944, with a predominance of short and violent episodes until 1872 and longer effusive eruptions since that date. Two factors mainly controlled the character of volcanic activity during this period: (1) the strength of the cone, which allowed, in the earlier period, an easy fracturing, rapid drainage, and pressure release of the magma column; (2) the interaction between magma and water, which enhanced the explosivity of several eruptions. The volcano appears to have reached a stage of quiescence because it finally attained a shape of equilibrium in which the height of the mountain is sufficient to counterbalance the buoyancy of the magma. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {In near-source conditions ({\textless} 5 km), the atmosphere is often assumed to be fully transparent to acoustic waves and to have a small effect on the acoustic wavefield. As a consequence, the propagation of the acoustic waves in the atmosphere near the source is often neglected and waveform is compensated only in amplitude by the inverse of the distance from the source. However, the amplitude distribution at five infrasonic stations deployed around the active craters of the Stromboli volcano, reveals anomalous decay up to. 11. dB larger than expected, which cannot be explained in terms of energy loss for geometrical spreading. The distribution of amplitude decay changes for different source positions, suggesting a strong relationship with the source-to-receiver path geometry. By using 2D-FDTD modeling, we show that the anomalous amplitude distribution of the acoustic waves at Stromboli is not necessarily due to the source radiation pattern but it is strongly influenced by the topography of the ground-atmosphere interface. Diffraction and reflection of topography contaminate the acoustic wavefield and have a strong effect in reducing the amplitude and altering the waveform. Our work demonstrates that line-of-sight conditions are quite difficult to be achieved in acoustic experiments and that a detailed knowledge of the topography along the crater-receiver path is necessary whenever infrasound waveforms are used to invert for the source process. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Cabezo Segura II volcanic cone (Calatrava volcanic province, Iberian microplate) comprises proximal wall deposits with a well defined crater wall unconformity and crater-fill deposits. The complex volcanic succession, that shows evidence of several eruptive episodes, was built by magmatic and hydrovolcanic explosions of different styles (Strombolian, Hawaiian, sub-Plinian and phreato-Strombolian) generated from a multiple feeder ultrabasic dyke. Intra-crater rock units at the volcano summit include spatter deposits together with up to 10. m thick and more than 200. m long lava-like bodies. Geological logs for the main lava-like bodies define a characteristic facies model that involves a central lava-like mass which grades vertically into a transition zone of apparently coherent spatter, then dense spatter and, finally, into vuggy spatter deposits. These units are inferred to have formed during pulsating lava fountain-type explosive eruptions; the depicted facies distribution being the result of progressive increase in welding grade and densification of the spatter in response to variations in the accumulation rate. Their field features may be used as a guide for the precise identification of vent sites in deposits of Hawaiian eruptions. Also, structures like those here recognised, that might have survived in lava-like flows, could be of help to identify when lava-producing eruptions represented an explosive Hawaiian event (lava fountains) and not a purely effusive event. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The dynamics of separated two-phase flow of basaltic magmas in cylindrical conduits has been explored combining large-scale experiments and theoretical studies. Experiments consisted of the continuous injection of air into water or glucose syrup in a 0.24 m diameter, 6.5 m long bubble column. The model calculates vesicularity and pressure gradient for a range of gas superficial velocities (volume flow rates/pipe area, 10{\&}{\#}8722;2{\&}{\#}8211;102 m/s), conduit diameters (100{\&}{\#}8211;2 m), and magma viscosities (3{\&}{\#}8211;300 Pa s). The model is calibrated with the experimental results to extrapolate key flow parameters such as Co (distribution parameter) and Froude number, which control the maximum vesicularity of the magma in the column, and the gas rise speed of gas slugs. It predicts that magma vesicularity increases with increasing gas volume flow rate and decreases with increasing conduit diameter, until a threshold value (45 vol.{\%}), which characterizes churn and annular flow regimes. Transition to annular flow regimes is expected to occur at minimum gas volume flow rates of 103{\&}{\#}8211;104 m3/s. The vertical pressure gradient decreases with increasing gas flow rates and is controlled by magma vesicularity (in bubbly flows) or the length and spacing of gas slugs. This study also shows that until conditions for separated flow are met, increases in magma viscosity favor stability of slug flow over bubbly flow but suggests coexistence between gas slugs and small bubbles, which contribute to a small fraction of the total gas outflux. Gas flow promotes effective convection of the liquid, favoring magma homogeneity and stable conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract District heating (DH) has an important role to play in enabling cities to transition to low-carbon heating. Although schemes are commonplace in some countries, in ‘learning countries' where building-level technologies make up the majority of heating systems there are numerous barriers to introducing DH. Local governments are seen as key actors in helping to create a ‘shared vision' for {\{}DH{\}} amongst stakeholders. This study uses interviews with stakeholders from a range of sectors in the {\{}UK{\}} (an example of a learning country) to examine the visions of local actors for developing {\{}DH{\}} and the types of national policy that would support local implementation of these visions. The analysis shows that in engaging with {\{}DH{\}} development local governments seek multiple types of value. Realising this value will most likely happen by taking a long-term, planned approach to development. In contrast, national government policy is geared towards techno-economic criteria and may lead to only a minority of potential sites being developed, without realisation of wider social or environmental benefits aligned to local visions. The work highlights the importance of local strategic planning, enabled by aligned national policy, in realising the full economic, environmental and social benefits of DH.},

Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and volcanoes can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data.We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent erosion.This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.},

abstract = {A theory of a volcanic eruption as a steady magma flow from a magma chamber to the surface is described. Magma is considered as a two-component two-phase medium and magma flow is steady, one-dimensional and isothermal. Mass and momentum exchange between condensed and gaseous phases is assumed to be in equilibrium with nucleation of bubbles as a fast process at small oversaturations. Three basic flow structures in a conduit are recognized and three resulting types of eruption are described. (1) In the discrete gas separation (DGS) flow, melt with discrete gas bubbles erupts. This type includes lava eruptions and Strombolian activity. (2) In the dispersion regime there is continuous eruption of a gas-pyroclastic suspension. Catastrophic explosive eruptions are included in this type. (3) Here a partly destroyed foam is erupted with permeable structure that allows gas escape. Near the surface this structure evolves with an increase in permeability and a decrease in the total porosity. This type corresponds to lava dome extrusions. A criterion dividing DGS flow from the other two regimes is obtained: Di = U??n 1/3 a/c0 where U is the magma ascent velocity, ?? is magma viscosity, n is number of bubble nuclei in a unit mass of magma, a is the solubility coefficient for volatiles in magma and c0 is the volatile content. The boundary between the dispersion regime and the partly destroyed foam regime depends on U, c0 and particle size dp. For the dispersion regime the basic governing parameters are: magma chamber depth H, conduit conductivity ?? = b 2/ ?? (b is the characteristic cross-dimension of the conduit), and excess pressure in the magma chamber. Instability of the dispersion regime is investigated numerically. The dependence of magma discharge rate on the governing parameters is described as a combination of equilibrium surfaces with cusp catastrophes. Magma chamber depth is a 'splitting' parameter in most cusps and controls the existence of unstable magma flow with sharp regime changes. Catastrophic rise of eruption intensity is possible if H {\textless} Hcr. The critical chamber depth Hcr depends approximately linearly on c0 and is about 15 km at c0 =0.05. Some scenarios of eruption evolution are described in a steady state approximation, and the mechanism of catastrophic explosive eruptions is proposed. The theory is applied to well documented eruptions (Tolbachik, 1975-1976, and Mount St. Helens, 1980). The theory can also describe changes in a volcanic system, such as destruction of the conduit or chamber walls, destruction of the edifice, changes in magma composition, and caldera subsidence due to magma evacuation. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Eruption mass and mass flow rate are critical parameters for determining the aerial extent and hazard of volcanic emissions. Infrasound waveform inversion is a promising technique to quantify volcanic emissions. Although topography may substantially alter the infrasound waveform as it propagates, advances in wave propagation modeling and station coverage permit robust inversion of infrasound data from volcanic explosions. The inversion can estimate eruption mass flow rate and total eruption mass if the flow density is known. However, infrasound-based eruption flow rates and mass estimates have yet to be validated against independent measurements, and numerical modeling has only recently been applied to the inversion technique. Here we present a robust full-waveform acoustic inversion method, and use it to calculate eruption flow rates and masses from 49 explosions from Sakurajima Volcano, Japan. Six infrasound stations deployed from 12–20 February 2015 recorded the explosions. We compute numerical Green's functions using 3-D Finite Difference Time Domain modeling and a high-resolution digital elevation model. The inversion, assuming a simple acoustic monopole source, provides realistic eruption masses and excellent fit to the data for the majority of the explosions. The inversion results are compared to independent eruption masses derived from ground-based ash collection and volcanic gas measurements. Assuming realistic flow densities, our infrasound-derived eruption masses for ash-rich eruptions compare favorably to the ground-based estimates, with agreement ranging from within a factor of two to one order of magnitude. Uncertainties in the time-dependent flow density and acoustic propagation likely contribute to the mismatch between the methods. Our results suggest that realistic and accurate infrasound-based eruption mass and mass flow rate estimates can be computed using the method employed here. If accurate volcanic flow parameters are known, application of this technique could be broadly applied to enable near real-time calculation of eruption mass flow rates and total masses. These critical input parameters for volcanic eruption modeling and monitoring are not currently available.},

abstract = {In studies of volcanic tephra, it is usual that the overall volume of tephra is estimated ashfall volumes based on representative locations within the ashfall area. The precision of the volume estimation largely depends on the number of the locations. However, in the case of ongoing eruptions on island volcanoes, such as Sakurajima volcano, the observation locations are usually limited. We therefore have developed a practical method for estimating ashfall volume and distribution in such case. The method approximates the distribution of ashfall as ellipses, with the distribution area (A) and thickness or weight of deposit (T) determined by A=$\alpha$T{\^{}}{\textless}-1{\textgreater}. The ellipse-approximated isopachs can be determined by using the direction of the ellipse axis and ashfall data at two points. In determing the ellipse axis exactly, we usually need additional ashfall amounts from the other locations. We set 37 samplers around Sakurajima volcano, and retrieved the samplers 15 times, from April to December, 2008. Using the propose method, we are able to determine the volume of ash produced by small, continuous eruptions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Strombolian eruptions are among the most common subaerial styles of explosive volcanism worldwide. Distinctive features of each volcano lead to a correspondingly wide range of variations of magnitude and erupted products, but most papers focus on a single type of event at a single volcano. Here, in order to emphasize the common features underlying this diversity of styles, we scrutinize a database from 35 different erupting vents, including 21 thermal infrared videos from Stromboli (Italy), Etna (Italy), Yasur (Vanuatu), and Batu Tara (Indonesia), from puffing, through rapid explosions to normal explosions, with variable ejection parameters and relative abundance of gas, ash, and bombs. Using field observations and high-speed thermal infrared videos processed by a new algorithm, we identify the distinguishing characteristics of each type of activity and how they may relate and interact. In particular, we record that ash-poor normal explosions may be preceded and followed by the onset or the increase of the puffing activity, while ash-rich explosions are emergent, i.e., with inflation of the free surface followed directly by emission of increasingly large gas pockets. Overall, we see that all Strombolian activities form a continuum arising from a common mechanism and are modulated by the combination of two well-established controls: (1) the length of the bursting gas pocket with respect to the vent diameter and (2) the presence and thickness of a high-viscosity layer in the uppermost part of the volcanic conduit.},

abstract = {In recent decades, systematic microgravity studies over some 20 active volcanoes in Central America, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Papua New Guinea and the USA have provided valuable data on sub-surface mass redistribution associated with volcanic activity. Concurrent data on ground deformation are essential to the unambiguous interpretation of gravity changes. In some instances, gravity and elevation vary along the free-air or Bouguer gradients, implying that there has been no sub-surface mass or density change, respectively. Where there are residual gravity changes after correction for elevation changes, magma movements in sub-surface chambers, feeder systems, vents and fissures (dykes) or water table variations are proposed. Although detailed interpretations depend on local circumstances and the calculations depend on source geometry, in general, the smallest residual gravity changes are associated with eruptions from volatile-poor basaltic vents and at extensional rift zones, whereas the highest residual values occur at explosive, subduction-related stratocones built from volatile-rich andesitic magma. The most intriguing, yet difficult, data to interpret derive from large-volume, infrequently erupting volcanic systems where caldera unrest is now becoming well documented and the ultimate hazards are most severe. Mass increases during inflation followed by limited mass loss during subsequent deflation typify these structures. ?? 1994.},

We propose that large-amplitude and long-duration infrasonic ({\textless}20 Hz) signals recorded at ranges of tens of kilometers during powerful eruptions at Mount St. Helens, USA, and Tungurahua, Ecuador, represent a low frequency form of jet noise. A preliminary test of this hypothesis is made by comparing the observed infrasonic spectra to the empirically-derived similarity spectra for pure-air jets. Although the spectral shapes are in approximate agreement, the observed volcanic signals have additional complexities not present in the pure-air laboratory data. These features may result from multiphase flow containing solid particles and liquid droplets, very high temperatures, and perhaps complex crater morphology. However, the overall similarity between the volcanic signals and jet noise indicates that broadband infrasound measurements at volcanoes may provide a quantitative link to eruption jet dynamics, and would aid substantially in the remote assessment of volcanic hazard.},

abstract = {The nucleation and growth of liquidus phases in cooling magmas at constant rates are modeled taking into account homogeneous nucleation, diffusion-limited growth, and depletion of crystallizing component from melt, and the temperature-dependent diffusivity. The formulation of governing equations shows that four dimensionless parameters, whose physical meainings are the nucleation difficulty, the fusion enthalpy, the ratio of the growth rate to the cooling rate, and the activation energy of diffusion, control the crystallization phenomena. The nucleation behavior with time (or temperature) is determined primarily by the competition between increasing nucleation rate with cooling and the reduced supersaturation with depletion by progressive growth of crystals previously nucleated. The maximum nucleation rate and the number density of crystals increase with decreasing interfacial tension and diffusivity, and with increasing fusion enthalpy and cooling rate. Quantitative expressions of the time or temperature interval for which the nucleation remains appreciable, the peak nucleation rate, the number density of crystals and the mean crystal radius are derived as functions of controlling parameters, and can be used to estimate the cooling rate or other unknown parameters from the number density of crystals of a rock.},

abstract = {Volcanic activity at Mount Erebus is dominated by eruptive activity within a phonolitic summit lava lake. Common eruption styles range from passive degassing to Strombolian explosions, which typically occur several times daily, and occasionally in swarms of up to 900 per day. Shallow explosions, although generally the result of steady exsolution of volatiles from depth, can be triggered by surficial input of H2O through mass wasting of rock, snow and ice from the crater walls. Broadband observations of Strombolian explosions document very-long-period (VLP) signals with strong spectral peaks near 20, 12 and 7 s, which are polarized in the vertical/radial plane. These signals precede lava lake surface explosions by {\~{}} 1.5 s, are highly repeatable, and persist for up to 200 s. First motions indicate a deflationary source, with any precursory inflation being below the {\~{}} 30 s passband of our instruments. Particle motions suggest a VLP source residing up to 800 m below the lava lake surface; however, this depth could be exaggerated by near-field radial tilt. Seismic and acoustic signals associated with lava lake explosions commonly show evidence for multiple bubble bursts in corresponding complexity features resulting from varying time delays and relative sizes of superimposed bursts. A systematic decrease in seismic/acoustic ratio for smaller surface explosions suggests that either the seismic energy from the smallest, shallowest bubble bursts experiences much greater seismic attenuation than energy arising from larger events which may involve a deeper, less attenuative portion of the magma column, and/or that the shallowest layer is seismically isolated from deeper parts of a stratified magma column, which are not excited by the smallest explosions due to sharp impedance contrasts across distinct layers. Tremor at Erebus is uncommon, with only a few isolated instances identified in five years of monitoring. Some tremor events are nearly monochromatic, and some exhibit numerous gliding harmonic spectral lines. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Different types of regular and irregular self-organized structures observed in deformation of colloid and polymer substances ("complex fluids") are discussed and classified. This review is focused on experimental evidence of structure formation and self-organization in shear flows, which have many similar features in systems of different types. For single-phase (uniform) polymer systems regular periodic surface structures are observed. Two main types of these structures are possible: small-scale regular screw-like periodic structures along the whole stream (usually called "shark-skin") and long-period smooth and distorted parts of a stream attributed as a "stick-slip" effect. The origin of surface irregularities of both types is elasticity of a liquid. In the limiting case of high enough Weissenberg numbers, medium loses fluidity and should be treated as a rubbery matter. The liquid-to-rubbery transition at high Weissenberg numbers is considered as the dominating mechanism of instability, leading in particular to the wall slip and rupture of a stream. Secondary flows ("vorticity") in deformation polymeric substances and complex fluids are also obliged to their elasticity and the observed Couette-Taylor-like cells, though being similar to well-known inertial secondary flows, are completely determined by elasticity of colloid and polymeric systems. In deformation of colloidal systems, suspensions and other dense concentrated heterophase materials, structure formation takes place at rest and the destroying of the structure happens as the yield stress. In opposite to this case, strong deformations can lead to the shear-induced structure formation and jamming. These effects are of general meaning for any complex fluids as well as for dense suspensions and granular media. Strong deformations also lead to separation of a stream into different parts (several "bands") with various properties of liquids in these parts. So, two principal effects common for any polymers and complex fluids can be pointed at as the physical origin of self-organization in shearing. This is elasticity of a liquid and a possibility of its existence in different phases or relaxation states, while in many cases elasticity of a fluid is considered as the most important provoking factor for transitions between different types of rheological behavior, e.g. the fluid-to-rubbery-like behavior at high deformation rates and the transition from the real laminar flow to wall slip. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Data were collected along a microgravity network of 69 stations at a monthly to annual sampling rate, depending on each subarray of the network. Results show that seasonal changes in water level within the volcano may induce gravity changes of up to 20 mu gal on Etna's southern slope, and indicate that significant magma movement occurred within and below Etna's edifice between 1994 and 1996. In particular, between September 1994 and October 1995, a mass increase of 2 x 10(10) kg occurred 2000 m beneath the summit craters. Between October 1995 and July 1996 this mass was lost, while another 2 x 1010 kg was injected at about 1000 m a.s.l. into the 1989 fracture system. From the gravity data alone, it is not possible to distinguish whether the first shallow intrusion (1994-1995) was then injected laterally into the 1989 fracture, or summit activity was fed by the first shallow intrusion, while new magma entered the 1989 fracture system. While magma was being redistributed within the volcanic edifice, measurements along an E-W-trending profile on the southern slope of the volcano detected some 1.5 x 10(11) kg of magma accumulating 2-3 km below sea level between October 1995 and November 1996.},

abstract = {The 660-km depth endothermic phase transition is expected to delay upwelling plumes and modify their morphology. The interaction of thermal starting plumes with a density boundary is investigated experimentally by using simultaneous visualizations of temperature, composition and velocity fields. In a tank initially stratified with two viscous fluids with different densities and viscosities, a thermal starting plume was generated by using a circular plate heater at the bottom of the tank. Its interaction mode with the inner interface depends on the local buoyancy number (BL: the ratio of the stabilizing chemical buoyancy to the plume thermal buoyancy at the interface), the Rayleigh number (Ra), the viscosity contrast between the chemical layers ($\gamma$), and the local viscosity ratio of the ambient material to the plume head ($\gamma$p). For BL {\textless} 0.6, the "pass-through mode" develops, whereby a large volume of the lower material rises through the upper layer and reaches the top surface, since the plume head has a large thermal buoyancy compared to the stabilizing density contrast between the two layers. When BL {\textgreater} 0.6, the "rebirth mode" occurs, where the thermal plume ponds and spreads under the chemical boundary and secondary thermal plumes are generated from the interface. Depending on the magnitude of BL, these plumes can entrain upwards by viscous coupling a significant amount of lower layer material. Scaling laws are determined for the onset of secondary plumes, their number and wavelength, the amount of entrainment and the topography of the interface.

A dishomogeneous body of diluted water (Cl less than 2.5 g/kg), that occurs at depths {\textgreater} 700 m and reequilibrates at 240°C at least, is overlain by an aquifer of groundwater variably mixed with variably seawater (Cl from 4 to 10 g/kg), which tends to reequilibrate at 160°C. Steam-heated waters locally develop and act as dilutants of the rising geothermal fluids. Dilution, mixing, and evaporation of the ascending chloride fluids are supported by oxygen and hydrogen isotopic data the thermal waters being enriched in 18O and D with respect to local meteoric water by up to 7 and 30‰, respectively. The relative composition of the major cations in thermal solutions was used to discriminate the two main groups of thermal waters, the reservoir temperatures of which are estimated from the Na/K-gethermometer. K-Mg geothermometer indicates reequilibration in near-surface conditions. The isotopic composition of the fumarolic steam varies from -7 to -12‰ in ∂8O and from - 35 to - 70‰ in ∂D, in agreement with a deep mixed fluid that boils adiabatically from 240 to 80°C. The deuterium content of the H2O-H2 pair gives enrichment factor of about 830‰, corresponding to equilibrium temperature conditions slightly higher than the surface boiling temperatures. The ∂13C of CO2is almost constant at -4.5‰ (1$\delta$=0.4), suggesting an important magmatic contribution, and the ∂18O values of CO2appears to in equilibrium with accompanying steam at the measured temperatures. The CO2/Ar and H2/Ar chemical ratios have been used to derive aquifer temperatures, the values obtained being consistent with those of solute geothermometers. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {We conduct an analysis of the concomitant, competing phenomena at play in the formation of long filamentary structures from a stream of hot, very viscous and cohesive liquid as it is blown by a fast, cool air stream. The situation is relevant to a broad class of problems, namely volcanic glass threads or fibers formed when small particles of molten material are thrown into the air and spun out by the wind into long hair-like strands (called Pele's hair), to the process of prilling, the manufacture of glass fibers, and the formation of coke in furnaces and combustion chambers.The air stream blowing on the molten material both breaks up the liquid into fragments stabilized by capillarity, and cools the liquid down to solidification. There are, in this problem, four characteristic times. First, a deformation time of the liquid masses, setting the rate at which drops elongate into ligaments. Then, two timescales set the time of capillary breakup of these ligaments, one prevailing on the other depending on the relative weight of inertia on viscous slowing (that point is illustrated by an original experiment). Finally, a solidification time of the ligaments. Thin solid strands will only form when solidification occurs before capillary breakup. We have discovered that this condition is likely to apply when the liquid is strongly viscous, as for clinker in the cement industry, considered here as a generic example. We formulate recommendations to remove (or enhance) the formation of these objects. {\textcopyright} 2012 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences.},

abstract = {In late 2007, a perched lava channel, built up to 45 m above the preexisting surface, developed during the ongoing eruption near Pu'u 'AOE'Ai cone on KA {\textless}{\textless} lauea Volcano's east rift zone. The lava channel was segmented into four pools extending over a total of 1.4 km. From late October to mid-December, a cyclic behavior, consisting of steady lava level rise terminated by vigorous spattering and an abrupt drop in lava level, was commonly observed in pool 1. We use geologic observations, video, time-lapse camera images, and seismicity to characterize and understand this cyclic behavior. Spattering episodes occurred at intervals of 40-100 min during peak activity and involved small (5-10-m-high) fountains limited to the margins of the pool. Most spattering episodes had fountains which migrated downchannel. Each spattering episode was associated with a rapid lava level drop of about 1 m, which was concurrent with a conspicuous cigar-shaped tremor burst with peak frequencies of 4-5 Hz. We interpret this cyclic behavior to be gas pistoning, and this is the first documented instance of gas pistoning in lava well away from the deeper conduit. Our observations and data indicate that the gas pistoning was driven by gas accumulation beneath the visco-elastic component of the surface crust, contrary to other studies which attribute similar behavior to the periodic rise of gas slugs. The gas piston events typically had a gas mass of about 2,500 kg (similar to the explosions at Stromboli), with gas accumulation and release rates of about 1.1 and 5.7 kg s(-1), respectively. The time-averaged gas output rate of the gas pistoning events accounted for about 1-2{\%} of the total gas output rate of the east rift zone eruption.},

abstract = {We have undertaken detailed observations of the formation of the 'Laghetto' cinder cone, a new cone that formed during a 2-week period of intense activity in Piano del Lago, on the upper slopes of Mount Etna in summer 2001. We describe the events leading to the formation of a small graben, the formation of pit craters on the base of the graben, the onset of phreatomagmatic activity, a transition to intense Strombolian activity, and a return to phreatomagmatic activity as the eruption came to an end. We discuss the reasons for these transitions, and describe the morphological development of the cone during these events. Arcuate cracks on the southern part of the cone were related to withdrawal of magma at the end of the eruption. Other slope instabilities that developed during the eruption include the formation of small radial grain flows on the outer flanks of the cone and the collapse into the crater of part of the crater rim. Some of the failure planes we observed were first identified using a FLIR TM 695 thermal infrared camera. This is the first time that infrared thermography has been used to detect instability of volcanic structures. Results obtained during this test case demonstrate that thermal cameras are a very useful tool for studies of volcanic instability. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Eruptions through debris-filled vents produce deposits containing magmatic juvenile lithic and recycled clasts. Recycled clasts are exposed to multiple transportation and fragmentation events. We used experiments with multiple subsurface explosions to track clasts and highlight dominant recycling processes in eruptions through analog debris-filled vents. Recycled clasts include those that fall back into and reside in the vent for extended time periods and those that return to the vent through crater growth or collapse. Clasts are recycled by any combination of lofting and fallback of material in the crater by explosion jets, mixing and churning of material at depth in the debris fill, and redistribution of extra-crater deposits by explosion-induced excavation or slumping. We compare experimental processes with natural deposits that preserve recycling signatures from discrete explosions through debris-filled vents such as maar-diatremes, Strombolian vents, and hydrothermal craters. Clasts may not preserve textures diagnostic of their complete recycling histories, but can be used to infer if that history occurred in part in the vent debris or in the eruptive jet. Experiment results and natural deposits suggest that for volcanic craters that undergo multiple explosions, clasts likely undergo some form of recycling before final deposition outside the craters. The underestimation of recycled clast contributions to deposits can lead to inaccurate estimates of thermal budgets and eruption processes.},

abstract = {The current (March 2008 to February 2009) summit eruptive activity at Kilauea Volcano is characterized by explosive degassing bursts accompanied by very long period (VLP) seismic signals. We model the source mechanisms of VLP signals in the 10–50 s band using data recorded for 15 bursts with a 10‐station broadband network deployed in the summit caldera. To determine the source centroid location and source mechanism, we minimize the residual error between data and synthetics calculated by the finite difference method for a point source embedded in a homogeneous medium that takes topography into account. The VLP signals associated with the bursts originate in a source region ∼1 km below the eastern perimeter of Halemaumau pit crater. The observed waveforms are well explained by the combination of a volumetric component and a vertical single force component. For the volumetric component, several source geometries are obtained which equally explain the observed waveforms. These geometries include (1) a pipe dipping 64° to the northeast; (2) two intersecting cracks including an east striking crack (dike) dipping 80° to the north, intersecting a north striking crack (another dike) dipping 65° to the east; (3) a pipe dipping 58° to the northeast, intersecting a crack dipping 48° to the west–southwest; and (4) a pipe dipping 57° to the northeast, intersecting a pipe dipping 58° to the west–southwest. Using the dual‐crack model as reference, the largest volume change obtained among the 15 bursts is ∼24,400 m3, and the maximum amplitude (peak to peak) of the force is ∼20 GN. Each burst is marked by a similar sequence of deflation and inflation, trailed by decaying oscillations of the volumetric source. The vertical force is initially upward, synchronous with source deflation, then downward, synchronous with source reinflation, followed by oscillations with polarity opposite to the volumetric oscillations. This combination of force and volume change is attributed to pressure and momentum changes induced during a fluid dynamic source mechanism involving the ascent, expansion, and burst of a large slug of gas within the upper ∼150 m of the magma conduit. As the slug expands upon approach to the surface and more liquid becomes wall supported by viscous shear forces, the pressure below the slug decreases, inducing conduit deflation and an upward force on the Earth. The final rapid slug expansion and burst stimulate VLP and LP oscillations of the conduit system, which slowly decay due to viscous dissipation and elastic radiation. Consideration of the fluid dynamic arguments leads us to prefer the dual‐crack VLP source model as it is the only candidate model capable of producing plausible values of length scales and pressure changes. The magnitudes of the vertical forces observed in the 15 bursts appear consistent with slug masses of 104 to 106 kg.},

abstract = {Volcanological processes, such as melt segregation, ascent and eruption are directly dependent on the rheological behaviour of magmatic suspensions. An increase of the crystal fraction of the suspension leads to the formation of a solid particle network which abruptly increases magma viscosity. The crystal fraction at which this rheological transition occurs depends on parameters such as the strain rate and the shape of particles. To determine the influence of the latter on the rheological transition, suspensions of plagioclase, a representative anisometric crystal, have been investigated at high temperatures and pressures. Synthetic suspensions with crystal fractions ($\phi$s) ranging from 0.38 to 0.75 were deformed both in compression and torsion in a Paterson apparatus at 300 MPa, 900 and 800°C, and for strain rates between 1.0 x 10-5 s-1 and 1.0 x 10-3 s-1. All suspensions exhibit a non-Newtonian strain thinning rheological behaviour. The experimental results, coupled with existing data and models at low crystal fractions ($\phi$s {\textless} 0.3), allow several rheological domains to be identified, from steady-state flow to strain weakening, each characterized by a specific microstructure. In particular, a progressive evolution from a pervasive to a strain partitioning fabric is found when increasing the crystal fraction. Our results highlight the influence of both the strain rate and the shape of crystals on the rheological behaviour of magmas. During crystallization, magmatic suspensions of anisometric minerals such as plagioclase would develop a solid particle network earlier ($\phi$s {\~{}} 0.3) than suspensions of isometric minerals ($\phi$s {\~{}} 0.5).},

Accumulation of magma is also accompanied by crustal deformation, usually manifested at the surface as uplift. These two modes of deformation – bulk compression of resident magma and deformation of the volcanic edifice – act in concert to accommodate the volume of newly added magma. During deflation, the processes reverse and reservoir magma undergoes bulk decompression, the chamber contracts, and the ground surface subsides. Because magma compression plays a role in creating subsurface volume to accommodate magma, magma budget estimates that are derived from surface uplift observations without consideration of magma compression will underestimate actual magma volume changes.},

abstract = {Liquid explosions, generated by rapid degassing of strongly supersaturated liquids, have been investigated in the laboratory with a view to understanding the basic physical processes operating during bubble nucleation and growth and the subsequent behavior of the expanding two-phase flow. Experiments are carried out in a shock tube and are monitored by high-speed photography and pressure transducers. Theoretical CO2 supersaturations up to 455 times the ambient saturation concentration are generated by a chemical reaction; K2CO3 solution is suddenly injected into an excess of HCl solution in such a way as to mix the two solutions rapidly. Immediately after the injection event, a bubble nucleation delay of a few milliseconds is followed by rapid nucleation and explosive expansion of CO2 bubbles forming a highly heterogeneous foam. Enhanced diffusion due to advection in the flow coupled with continuous mixing of the reactants, and hence on-going bubble nucleation after injection, generates an increasingly accelerating flow until the reactants become depleted at peak accelerations of around 150 g and velocities of about 15 m s-1. Stretching of the accelerating two-phase mixture enhances the mixing. Liberation of CO2 vapor is spatially inhomogeneous leading to ductile fragmentation occurring throughout the flow in regions of greatest gas release as the consequence of the collision and stretching of fluid streams. The violence of the eruptions is controlled by using different concentrations of the HCl and K2CO3 solutions, which alters the CO2 supersaturation and yield and also the efficiency of the mixing process. Peak acceleration is proportional to theoretical supersaturation. Pressure measurements at the base of the shock tube show an initial nucleation delay and a pressure pulse related to the onset of explosive bubble formation. These chemically induced explosions differ from liquid explosions created in other experiments. In explosions caused by sudden depressurization of CO2-saturated water, the bubbles nucleate uniformly throughout the liquid in a single nucleation event. Subsequent bubble growth causes the two-phase mixture to be accelerated upward at nearly constant accelerations. Explosively boiling liquids, in which heterogeneous nucleation is suppressed, experience an evaporation wave which propagates down into the liquid column at constant average velocity. Fragmentation occurs at the sharply defined leading edge of the wavefront. The chemical flows effectively simulate highly explosive volcanic eruptions as they are comparable in terms of flow densities, velocities, accelerations, and in the large range of scales present. The large accelerations cause strong extensional strain and longitudinal deformation. Comparable deformation rates in volcanic systems could be sufficient to approach conditions for brittle fragmentation. Tube pumice is a major component of plinian deposits and ignimbrites and preserves evidence of accelerating flow conditions.},

Comparison of the measured volcanic gas composition with volatile contents in a gas-rich melt inclusion indicates that the gas separation from magma occurs at low pressure. The measured H2O/CO2 and CO2/SO2 ratios of the gas were constant for about two hours during the measurements in spite of intermittent lava spattering from the vent, indicating that the gas emitted with the spattering lava has the same composition as the continuously emitted volcanic gas. This implies the lava spattering is not driven by bubbles supplied at depth but caused by bursting of bubbles formed under equilibrium with the magma.},

abstract = {We investigated characteristics of eruption tremor observed for 24 eruptions at 18 volcanoes based on published reports. In particular, we computed reduced displacements (DR) to normalize the data and examined tremor time histories. We observed: (a) maximum DR is approximately proportional to the square root of the cross sectional area of the vent, however, with lower than expected slope; (b) about one half of the cases show approximately exponential increases in DR at the beginnings of eruptions, on a scale of minutes to hours; (c) one half of the cases show a sustained maximum level of tremor; (d) more than 90{\%} of the cases show approximately exponential decay at the ends of eruptions, also on a scale of minutes to hours; and (e) exponential increases, if they occur, are commonly associated with the first large stage of eruptions. We estimate the radii of the vents using several methods and reconcile the topographic estimates, which are systematically too large, with those obtained from DR itself and theoretical considerations. We compare scaling of tremor DR with that for explosions and find that explosions have large absolute pressures and scale with vent radius squared, whereas tremor consists of pressure fluctuations that have lower amplitudes than the absolute pressure of explosions, and the scaling is different. We explore several methods to determine the appropriate scaling. This characteristic helps us to distinguish the type of eruptions: explosive (Vulcanian or Strombolian) eruptions versus sustained or continuous ash (e.g. Plinian) eruptions. Average eruption discharge, estimated from the total volume of tephra and the total duration of eruption tremor, is well correlated with peak discharge calculated from cross sectional area of the vent and velocity of volcanic ejecta. These results suggest similar scaling between different eruption types and the overall usefulness of monitoring tremor for evaluating volcanic activity. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Characteristics of convective flows produced by buoyancy of small bubbles rising from the horizontal bottom of a thin water layer are investigated with laboratory experiments, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis for steady convection cells. Immediately after the production of bubbles, small plumes of bubble-contained fluid are produced by Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The laboratory experiment suggests that the convective pattern is modified from plumes to cellular convection when the plumes reach the top of the fluid layer. There is a tendency for the aspect ratio of the cell to increase with the bubble flux, and this tendency was confirmed by numerical simulations. The analysis for steady convection cells also derived consistent solutions: a convection cell with too large a horizontal scale cannot be sustained, and the critical scale increases with the flux of the bubbles. The convective patterns in the final stage depend mainly upon the volume flux (F) of the bubbles and the rising velocity (wb) of a bubble in a still fluid. According to the numerical simulation, the steady cellular pattern is obtained only in limited combinations of F and wb. It is also found that the steady organized cellular convection is only sustained in a system without diffusion of the buoyancy. If the buoyancy diffuses across the trajectories of bubbles, the cellular convection eventually disappears. In the final steady state the buoyancy is transported only by the rising velocity of bubbles. In this respect, this convective motion is quite different from B{\'{e}}nard convection where the steady cellular convection is maintained in a diffusive system. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The growth of lava domes is often associated with cyclic variations of ground deformation, seismicity and mass flux of gas and magma. We present a model of cyclic volcanic activity which is controlled by degassing of supersaturated magma, magma flow into the conduit, gas escape from the permeable magma, deformation of the conduit walls and the friction between the walls and the plug at the top of the conduit. When the difference between magma pressure and ambient pressure exceeds the static friction, motion begins, bubbles expand and overpressure relaxes. Bubble expansion builds permeability, allows gas escape and faster depressurization. Depressurization and crystallization of the magma build supersaturation and gas diffusion from melt to bubbles. Gas flux into bubbles and magma flux from the chamber act to increase pressure. The rate of extrusion is controlled by the gas pressure, driving the motion, and by the rate- and state-dependent friction along shear zones between the plug and the host rock. When the magma overpressure drops to the dynamic strength of the slip surfaces, the plug sticks and blocks the vent. As bubble volume is now constant, exsolution of gas from the supersaturated melt leads to pressurization and begins a new cycle.},

abstract = {This paper reports a sequence of harmonic tremor observed during the 2011 eruption of Shinmoe-dake volcano, Kyushu, Japan. The main eruptive activity started with subplinian eruptions, followed by lava effusion. Harmonic tremor was observed as seismic waves during the final stage of the effusive eruption. The tremor observed at this stage had unclear and fluctuating harmonic modes. In the atmosphere, however, many impulsive acoustic waves indicating small surface explosions were observed. When effusion stopped and explosive degassing began, harmonic tremor was observed as acoustic waves in the air and in the seismic data, and the harmonic modes became clearer and more stable. This transition in the character of the harmonic tremor coincided with rapid deflation of the lava that had accumulated in the crater. Based on these observations, and laboratory experiments reproducing the features of the wave fields, it is concluded that the harmonic tremor sequence at Shinmoe-dake was generated by gas flowing through channels in the gradually solidifying lava. Comparing our results with the few cases of similar transition observed at other volcanoes, we expect that the transition indicates changes in magma rheology and degassing conditions in the crater, and therefore of changes in eruptive activity.},

abstract = {Cosmogenic and radioactive 10Be, stable 9Be and B concentrations have been determined for four alkaline lavas from the recent cycle of historical activity at Mt. Vesuvius, in the Central Campania Province (Italy). The goal of this study was to use the Be isotope and Be-B systematics of these lavas in a manner analogous to that used in regions unequivocally related to active subduction, in hopes of being able to document a subduction origin for the Vesuvian lavas. Four lavas measured to date have low 10Be concentrations as well as low B/Be ratios. While the low 10Be concentrations could reflect subduction and incorporation of old sediments and/or only contributions from the basaltic part of the subducting plate, the combination of low 10Be and low B/Be ratios must be interpreted as the absence of a subduction signature in these lavas. Unfortunately, the absence of a subduction signature in the lavas cannot be used unequivocally to argue against recent subduction in the Central Campania region. Subduction of an unusually young, hot slab which has lost its B through prograde metamorphic reactions at shallow levels could explain the absence of a subduction signature, as could extensive crustal contamination. In addition, recent studies in Java show that alkaline lavas in this region of active subduction never show a subduction signature, even when erupting in close proximity to calc-alkaline and tholeiitic lavas which do; by analogy, the Vesuvian lavas studied may have been generated in a part of the sub-arc mantle which either does not experience or does not preserve the chemical signature of subduction modification. The present data set does not allow us to make definitive statements about the role of subduction in the origin of the Central Campania lavas. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {The formation, evolution, collapse, and subsequent resurrection of a vent within Halema'uma'u Crater, Kilauea Volcano, produced energetic and varied degassing signals recorded by a nearby infrasound array between 2008 and early 2009. After 25 years of quiescence, a vent-clearing explosive burst on 19 March 2008 produced a clear, complex acoustic signal. Near-continuous harmonic infrasonic tremor followed this burst until 4 December 2008, when a period of decreased degassing occurred. The tremor spectra suggest volume oscillation and reverberation of a shallow gas-filled cavity beneath the vent. The dominant tremor peak can be sustained through Helmholtz oscillations of the cavity, while the secondary tremor peak and overtones are interpreted assuming acoustic resonance. The dominant tremor frequency matches the oscillation frequency of the gas emanating from the vent observed by video. Tremor spectra and power are also correlated with cavity geometry and dynamics, with the cavity depth estimated at {\&}{\#}8764;219 m and volume {\&}{\#}8764;3 × 106 m3 in November 2008. Over 21 varied degassing bursts were observed with extended burst durations and frequency content consistent with a transient release of gas exciting the cavity into resonance. Correlation of infrasound with seismicity suggests an open system connecting the atmosphere to the seismic excitation process at depth. Numerous degassing bursts produced very long period (0.03{\&}{\#}8211;0.1 Hz) infrasound, the first recorded at Kilauea, indicative of long-duration atmospheric accelerations. Kilauea infrasound appears controlled by the exsolution of gas from the magma, and the interaction of this gas with the conduits and cavities confining it.},

abstract = {Short-periodic deformation cycles are a common phenomenon at active volcanoes and often attributed to the instability of magma flow in the upper plumbing system caused by fluctuations in magma viscosity related to cooling, degassing, and crystallization. We here present based on high-precision continuous borehole strain data 20-min periodic oscillations in ground deformation associated with the 2003 massive dome-collapse at the Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills Volcano, Montserrat (West Indies). The high-frequency oscillations lasted {\~{}}80min and were preceded by a 4-hour episode of rapid expansion of the shallow magma reservoir. Strain amplitude ratios indicate that the deformational changes were generated by pressure variations in the shallow magma reservoir and – in reversed polarity – the adjacent plumbing dike. The unusually short period of the oscillations cannot be explained with thermally induced variations in magma properties. We investigate the underlying mechanism of the oscillations via a numerical model of forced magma flow through a reservoir-dike system accounting for time-dependent dilation/contraction of the dike due to viscous response of the surrounding host rock. Our results suggest that the cyclic pressure variations are modulated from the dynamical interplay between rapid expansion of the magma chamber and the incapacity of the narrow dike to take up fast enough the magma volumes supplied by the reservoir. Our results allow for first order constraints on the viscosity of crustal host rocks and consequently its fractional melt content. We present as such for the first time crustal-scale in situ measurements of rheological properties of mush zones surrounding magmatic systems.},

This phenomenon is known as "flooding". It is suggested that flooding is caused by the appearance of infinitesimal waves moving with the interfacial velocity of the liquid. The stability of the gas-liquid interface has been examined using a linearized small-perturbation technique, and the critical gas velocity required to cause unstable waves has been calculated. These critical velocities are in excellent agreement with experimental data for the flooding velocity over a wide range of liquid viscosities. Although most of the available experimental data is for air and water (or glycerol-water solutions) the predicted flooding velocities are given in graphical form to enable the flooding point to be calculated for other gases and liquids. {\textcopyright} 1969.},

abstract = {Mechanical and phase equilibria in inclusion-host systems are investigated in this paper. An inclusion-host system that is initially under lithostatic pressure and in mechanical and phase equilibria may undergo pressure-temperature change. The new elastic and plastic equilibrium, possible viscous relaxation, and pahse equilibrium are considered. The new inclusions pressure typically differs from both the initial pressure and the pressure on the outside surface of the host. The inclusion is under isotropic stress (a single pressure) but the host is anisotropically stressed. The relative volume change of the inclusion differs from that of the inclusion-free host by 0.75(Pin - Pout)/Gh where Pin and Pout are the pressures on the inside and outside surfaces of the host, and Gh is the shear modulus of the host. Different inclusions in a single host may be under different pressures. A simple case of elastic anisotropy is also considered and the result shows that incorporation of elastic anisotropy is necessary for accurate calculations of volume and strain effect. For inclusions with roughly constant bulk modulus, the time scale of viscous relaxation is found to be 4$\eta$h/(3Ki) where $\eta$h is the viscosity of the host phase and Ki is the bulk modulus of the inclusion phase. If the host mineral does not relax viscously and does not fracture into pieces, the host mineral partially protects the inclusion and phase transition in the inclusion-host system is partial and spans a large T-P range even for one-component systems, in contrast to sharp pahse transitions under isobaric and isothermal conditions. For example, a graphite inclusion in a diamond host does not completely convert to diamond when pressure on the diamond host increases. Using the chemical potential formulation of Kamb, about 1{\%} of graphite would convert to diamond for every 1 GPa increase in host pressure. Because the inclusion pressure may be different from the lithostatic pressure on the host, pressure obtained from thermobarometers using inclusion-host pairs may not have depth significant. Correct 'reading' of information stored by inclusion-host pairs requires an understanding of mechanical and phase equilibria involving the inclusion and host.},

abstract = {We deployed a network of broadband seismometers for one year around the Naka-dake first crater of Aso volcano in Kyushu, Japan, to reveal the mechanism of long period tremors (LPTs) emitted from the volcano. It is observed that LPTs with a dominant period of about 15 s are always emitted regardless of the surface activity of the volcano. A typical LPT has a short duration less than a minute and its spectrum shows mode peaks at 15, 7.5, 5, and 3 s. The particle motion in the frequency band for the lowest two modes at stations within a few kilometers from the crater is rectilinear, pointing in the direction of the crater. A waveform semblance technique to locate sources of LPTs is devised to utilize the rectilinearity of waveforms. The LPT sources are located at depths of 1-1.5 km beneath the bottom of the crater. When the volcano is explosively ejecting steam and mud, on the other hand, a very long period ({\~{}}100 s) displacement (VLPD) polarized outward from the crater often precedes an eruptive event by a few minutes. A typical VLPD is accompanied by a few long period pulses, first positively polarized and concurrent with the onset of VLPD, then negatively polarized just before the eruption. The source of VLPDs is inferred to coincide approximately with that of LPT. On the basis of these observations, a qualitative model is constructed for the hydrothermal system beneath the Naka-dake first crater. An explanation for the unusually long period nature of the LPT is discussed in terms of a class of slow waves, which exist in solid-liquid two-phase systems. A possibility of realtime monitoring at Aso volcano using the observed long period seismic signals is also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Weakly supersaturated source liquids produce a low Reynolds number flow with foam expanding from the top surface of a liquid that exhibits zero fluid velocity at the tube wall; i.e., the conventional {\&}{\#}8220;no-slip{\&}{\#}8221; boundary condition. Pressure oscillations, often with strong long-period characteristics and consistent with longitudinal and radial resonant oscillation modes, are detected in these fluids. Strongly supersaturated source liquids generate more energetic flows that display a number of flow regimes. These regimes include a static liquid source, viscous flow, detached flow (comprising gas-pockets-at-wall and foam-in-gas annular flow, therefore demonstrating strong radial heterogeneity), and a fully turbulent transonic fragmented or mist flow. Each of these flow regimes displays characteristic pressure oscillations that can be related to resonance of flow features or wall impact phenomena. The pressure oscillations are produced by the degassing processes without the need of elastic coupling to the confining medium or flow restrictors and valvelike features. The oscillatory behavior of the experimental flows is compared to seismoacoustic data from a range of volcanoes where resonant oscillation of the fluid within the conduit is also often invoked as controlling the observed oscillation frequencies. On the basis of the experimental data we postulate on the nature of seismic signals that may be measured during large-scale explosive activity.},

abstract = {In January 2011, magmatic eruptions at Shinmoe-dake, Kirishima, Japan, started for the first time in 300 years. After three sub-plinian explosive events, lava accumulation started at the summit crater. The accumulation lasted for about three months, and the final volume of the accumulated lava reached 1.5 x 10(7) m(3). We conducted aeromagnetic surveys using an unmanned autonomous helicopter over the Shinmoe-dake summit crater in late May 2011, and late October to early November, 2011, in order to investigate the magnetization of this area and changes in the magnetic field associated with the 2011 eruption. The averaged magnetization intensity around Shinmoe-dake is 1.5 A/m. A demagnetized area elongated in the north to northwest direction from Shinmoe-dake has been detected. We also detected a clear change in the total magnetic field between the two aeromagnetic observations characterized by positive and negative changes in the south and north, respectively, of the Shinmoe-dake edifice. These changes are well reproduced by a model in which 20-70{\%} of lava accumulated in the summit crater was cooled down below the Curie temperature and has been magnetized.},

We used 0.25 Hz sample rate sulfur dioxide emission data from a UV camera and coincident infrasound recordings to investigate the link between varied emission rates and infrasound events. Degassing rates varied on two scales during this study; smaller, more rapid variations on the scale of 1 to 3 minutes are superimposed on larger, slower changes over 30 minutes to 1 hour. The acoustic record was dominated by repeated N-shaped events characteristic of Strombolian explosions. Because of the high-resolution of the gas measurements, we were able to calculate gas masses for individual explosions from both datasets and find the two estimates agree within an order of magnitude. The infrasound explosion records correlate with small pulses in degassing, but the longer-term degassing trends may represent a deeper process.},

Rock fracture, fluid flow, and gas expansion occur at variable time scales and induce superposed ground motions, including both static and dynamic deformation, and atmospheric pressure disturbances. Dissection of this composite event is facilitated through extra-seismic observations, such as infrasound, geodetic, and visual monitoring. Multi-parametric investigation of an eruptive event on Jan. 4th 2009 reveals increased degassing, apparent as both geodetic tilt and harmonic seismo-infrasonic tremor, preceding an explosive event. The explosive event itself entails surface dome uplift, multiple eruptive pulses, and subsequent re-equilibration of the volcanic edifice manifested in derived tilt. We report here on an integrated approach to discerning the physical processes at the actively effusing and exploding Santiaguito volcano and describe the composite earthquake that occurs here.},

abstract = {In order to address the question posed in the title, two tests have been applied to the sequence of repose periods between eruptions in two volcanoes (Piton de la Fournaise in La Reunion Island and Mauna Loa and Kilauea in Hawaii). In the first test a phase space is constructed from the sequence of repose periods. and the dimension D of the attractor is computed as a function of the dimension d of the embedding phase space. Dl(d) is found to saturate to a constant value around 2 (La Reunion) and around 4 (Hawaii) for large values of d. This signals the existence of a few degrees of freedom (of order 2 and 4), respectively, of the dynamical system underlying the time evolution of volcanic eruptions. Following this first observation we have then attempted to explain the deterministic dynamic by constructing a so-called ''return map'' of the repose periods. This is done by extracting a subsequence from the full sequence of repose periods between eruptions. Different schemes for obtaining these subsequences, corresponding to various Poincare sections. have been examined. One particular method is inspired by the specific Poincare section, consisting of selecting the maxima of one of the variables, which is used to analyze the Rossler and Lorenz attractors in the nonlinear physics literature. The return maps are found to be in reasonable agreement with what one should expect from a deterministic dynamical system spoiled, however, by noise. The analysis is not perfect because of additional fluctuations which are, however. not strong enough to blur completely the relevant information. These return maps are compared to those obtained from a set of repose periods artificially synthesized with a pseudo random number generator possessing the same distribution. However, the information provided by the return maps is not sufficient to determine the dynamical equations underlying the eruptions. Therefore a general procedure to test further the determinism of the data set, which generalizes the construction of the return map to arbitrary dimension. is presented. A three-dimensional representation of the attractor for the Piton de la Fournaise volcano) is given and compared with the same representation for a set of repose periods artificially synthesized with a pseudo random number generator. We find an attractor which presents a global structure reminiscent of the Rossler attractor band in the Duffing system. In contrast, the reconstructed ''attractor'' using a pseudo random generator does not exhibit a coherent structure. Adding together these different pieces of evidence, we conclude that volcanic eruptions might well be controlled by deterministic dynamics of low dimensions. While chaos places a fundamental limit on long-term prediction, it suggests the very interesting possibility of making efficient nonlinear short-term forecasting of new eruptions from the previous series of eruptions. We have not attempted to develop a nonlinear forecasting procedure from previous eruptions because, in order to be efficient, one needs first to identify as precisely as possible the geometrical structure of the reconstructed attractor. At present. the results do not have the necessary quality to carry out this project. We think that in the future, important improvements could be achieved by monitoring and recording a complete set of data related to the evolution of volcanoes.},

abstract = {The relics of two Late Devonian suba- queous rhyolitic dome-top tuff and pumice cone successions are preserved in the Bunga Beds out- lier of the Boyd Volcanic Complex, southeastern Australia. These cone successions and other rhyolitic volcanics of the Bunga Beds are asso- ciated with turbidite and other deep-water mass- flow sedimentary rocks. The two cone successions have a generally similar stratigraphy. At the base, flow-banded, variably autobrecciated and quench-fragmented rhyolite, representing an in- trusive to extrusive dome, is overlain by rhyolite- sediment breccia, representing extrusion of the dome through the deep-water sediment pile and resedimentation down its flanks. In the northern cone succession an overlying succession of bed- ded pumiceous crystal-rich to crystal-poor tuffs represents the onset of pyroclastic activity and growth of a tuff cone. An overyling debris flow deposit represents degradation of part of the cone. The topmost unit, a stratified pumice suc- cession, is thought to represent another cone- building eruptive phase, and is separated from the underlying strata by a major slide surface. The southern cone succession contains less tuff and abundant pumice, and is also terminated by a de- bris-flow deposit, indicating cone degradation. A modern analogue for the inferred eruptive style and sequence is the 1953-1957 rhyolite eruption that formed the Tuluman Island lava-tuff cone complex in the Bismarck Sea. The eruptions were often cyclical, consisting of an initial inferred sub- marine-lava-forming stage, passing into a pumice- cone-forming stage, in some cases a subaerial- lava-forming stage, and a final stage, following the cessation of volcanism, during which the cones collapsed gravitationally or were destroyed Offprint requests to: RAF Cas by wave erosion. Using observations from both the Tuluman Island eruptions and the preserved stratigraphies of the Devonian tuff cones, a dy- namic model is proposed for the formation of subaqueous rhyolitic dome-top tuff and pumice cones.},

abstract = {Over an 18 h interval in April 1994, the tremor at Lascar volcano, Chile, was characterized by a spectrum with narrow peaks at a fundamental frequency of about 0.63 Hz and more than 25 overtones at exact integer multiples. This harmonic tremor was recorded at four three-component, high-dynamic range stations during the deployment of the Proyecto de Investigacion Sismologica de la Cordillera Occidental 94 (PISCO'94). Usually this tremor's source is modeled as the resonance of a fluid-filled crack or organ pipe-like structure in the volcano. The resonance of a real, physical structure, however, can produce neither as many overtones nor such exact multiples as those observed in the harmonic tremor at Lascar. Harmonics also occur in a spectrum if the source signal is repetitive but nonsinusoidal. Fluid dynamics offers at least three realistic source models for harmonic tremor which produce repetitive, nonsinusoidal waveforms: the release of gas through a very small outlet (the soda bottle model), slug flow in a narrow conduit, and von Karman vortices produced at obstacles. These models represent different flow regimes, each with its own characteristic range of Reynolds numbers. For each model the fundamental frequency of the tremor is related to the Reynolds number for the flow. Combining the Reynolds numbers for each model with typical kinematic viscosities for the possible fluids present in a volcano-magma, water, steam, air or some combination, at appropriate temperatures and pressures-provides limits on such physical parameters of the volcano as the dimensions of the flow conduit and the flow velocity of the fluid generating the tremor. If any single one of these three models is actually the process in the volcano which generates harmonic tremor, then the tremor is caused by movements of water or gases in the hydrothermal system near the volcano's surface.

abstract = {Recent casualties in volcanic eruptions due to trauma from blocks and bombs necessitate more rigorous, ballistic specific risk assessment. Quantitative assessments are limited by a lack of experimental and field data on the vulnerability of buildings to ballistic hazards. An improved, quantitative understanding of building vulnerability to ballistic impacts is required for informing appropriate life safety actions and other risk reduction strategies. We assessed ballistic impacts to buildings from eruptions at Usu Volcano and Mt. Ontake in Japan and compiled available impact data from eruptions elsewhere to identify common damage patterns from ballistic impacts to buildings. We additionally completed a series of cannon experiments which simulate ballistic block impacts to building claddings to investigate their performance over a range of ballistic projectile velocities, masses and energies. Our experiments provide new insights by quantifying (1) the hazard associated with post-impact shrapnel from building and rock fragments; (2) the effect of impact obliquity on damage; and (3) the additional impact resistance buildings possess when claddings are struck in areas directly supported by framing components. This was not well identified in previous work which may have underestimated building vulnerability to ballistic hazards. To improve assessment of building vulnerability to ballistics, we use our experimental and field data to develop quantitative vulnerability models known as fragility functions. Our fragility functions and field studies show that although unreinforced buildings are highly vulnerable to large ballistics ({\textgreater} 20 cm diameter), they can still provide shelter, preventing death during eruptions.},

abstract = {Ground- and atmospheric-propagating elastic waves are integrated with digitized video to reconstruct important parameters during the onset of eruptions at Karymsky Volcano in 1999. Muzzle velocities, which range from 10 to 55 m/s for 34 analyzed explosive events, are found to be very well correlated with eruption velocities synthesized from infrasonic trace data. Acoustic modeling proposed here invokes a linear acoustic source consistent with a 3-m piston that accelerates upwards. Timing of acoustic arrivals relative to video records of material emission is used to constrain fragmentation sources depths, which are assumed to be coincident with infrasound generation. These sources are generally shallow, with an observed vertical range of about 15 m. Systematic changes in source depth are observed during two nights of data collection and are attributed to variations in the depth of the magma free surface. Relative timing of acoustic and seismic arrivals is used to identify the presence of seismicity prior to fragmentation. This seismicity is emergent and low intensity, but significant because it precedes the presumed fragmentation events by variable amounts up to 4 s. The primary short-period seismic phases appear coincident with the initiation of fragmentation and infrasound generation. Because of the complexity of the seismic Green's function, it is not possible to correlate amplitude from a specific seismic pulse with observed eruption intensity.},

abstract = {The explosive phase of the 2009 Redoubt Volcano eruption produced predominantly short duration, high-amplitude infrasound signals recorded up to 4500km away. All 19 numbered explosive events were recorded at a local microphone (DFR, 12km), as well as at an infrasound array in Fairbanks, Alaska (I53US, 547km), most with high signal to noise ratios. The local microphone provides an estimate of the source parameters, and comparison between the two datasets allows the unique opportunity to evaluate acoustic source term estimation at a remote array. High waveform similarity between DFR and I53US occurs during much of the explosive phase due to strong stratospheric ducting, permitting accurate source constraints inferred from I53US data. Cross-correlation analysis after applying a Hilbert transform to the I53US data shows how the acoustic energy has passed through a single caustic, as predicted by ray theory. Similar to previous studies, significant low-frequency infrasound from Redoubt recorded at I53US is coincident with high-altitude ash emissions. The largest events also produced considerable energy at greater than 50s periods, likely related to the initial oscillations of the volcanic plume or jet. Many of the explosive events have emergent onsets, somewhat unusual for explosive, short-duration eruptions. Comparison of the satellite-derived SO2emissions with the relative amount of acoustic energy at I53US shows a very high, statistically significant correlation. This study reiterates the utility of using remote infrasound arrays for detection of hazardous emissions and characterization of large volcanic eruptions, and demonstrates how, under typical meteorological conditions, remote infrasound arrays can provide an accurate representation of the acoustic source. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Porous flow of buoyant liquid through partially molten rock is regarded as the initial transport process leading to magma segregation in the mantle. Recent work has identified the importance of matrix deformation and compaction in this process. We present finite-difference calculations based on a generalized form of Darcy's law that includes matrix deformation, in two-dimensional Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. We emphasize the existence of solitary wave solutions, called magmons. These waves are regions of locally high porosity that ascend through regions of low, uniform porosity. They differ from diapirs, where the liquid and matrix ascend together. The one-dimensional waves that were previously reported are found to be unstable in two dimensions, breaking down to form two-dimensional waves of circular cross section. Both the development of the instability and the form of the two-dimensional waves are supported by theoretical analysis. Numerical experiments in which two-dimensional waves collide show that the extent to which they are conserved after collision depends on the lateral offset of the waves. The conservation can be very good; in other cases, larger waves appear to grow at the expense of smaller waves. Although the quantification of the relevant permeability and rheological parameters remains uncertain, geophysically plausible estimates suggest wavelengths of kilometers and velocities of centimeters per year. In our preliminary assessment of the relevance of these results to igneous processes, we find that magmons are unlikely to be important in regions of broad upwelling, such as beneath spreading centers. Here the transport of liquid adjusts to match the supply by melting, and compaction processes are not important. If liquid is supplied from below to a stable partially molten region of the asthenosphere, it is expected to ascend in magmons. This may occur beneath oceanic volcanic centers or in subcontinental mantle. It is possible that magma ascent in magmons leads to spatial and temporal episodicity of volcanic activity, if higher level processes do not obscure this influence. The waveform of a magmon ascends faster than the liquid within the magmon, so new liquid is taken in from above, while original liquid is lost from below. Consequently, magmons can mobilize small degrees of partial melt and deliver it rapidly to the surface.},

abstract = {The highly variable and unpredictable magnitude of thermal emission from evolving volcanic eruptions creates saturation problems for remote sensing instruments observing eruptions on Earth and on Io, the highly volcanic moon of Jupiter. For Io, it is desirable to determine the temperature of the erupting lavas as this measurement constrains lava composition. One method of determining lava eruption temperature is by measuring radiant flux at two or more wavelengths and fitting a blackbody thermal emission function. Only certain styles of volcanic activity are suitable, those where detectable thermal emission is from a restricted range of surface temperatures close to the eruption temperature. Volcanic processes where this occurs include large lava fountains; smaller lava fountains common in active lava lakes; and lava tube skylights. Problems that must be overcome to obtain usable data are: (1) the rapid cooling of the lava between data acquisitions at different wavelengths, (2) the unknown magnitude of thermal emission, which has often led to detector saturation, and (3) thermal emission changing on a shorter timescale than the observation integration time. We can overcome these problems by using the HOT-BIRD detector and a novel, advanced digital readout circuit (D-ROIC) to achieve a wide dynamic range sufficient to image lava on Io without saturating. We have created an instrument model that allows various instrument parameters (including mirror diameter, number of signal splits, exposure duration, filter band pass, and optics transmissivity) to be tested to determine the detectability of thermal sources on Io's surface. We find that a short-wavelength infrared instrument on an Io flyby mission can achieve simultaneity of observations by splitting the incoming signal for all relevant eruption processes and still obtain data fast enough to remove uncertainties in accurate determination of the highest lava surface temperatures. Observations at 1 and 1.5 $\mu$m are sufficient for this purpose. Even with a ten-way beam split, instrument throughput generates acceptable signal-to-noise values. Accurate constraints on lava eruption temperature are also possible with a visible wavelength detector so long as data at different wavelengths are obtained simultaneously and integration time is very short. Fast integration times are important for examining the thermal emission from lava tube skylights due to rapidly changing viewing geometry during close flybys. The technology described here is applicable to instruments observing terrestrial volcanism and for investigating proposed volcanic activity on Venus, where lava composition is not known.},

abstract = {During operational ash-cloud forecasting, prediction of ash concentration and total erupted mass directly depends on the determination of mass eruption rate (MER), which is typically inferred from plume height. Uncertainties for plume heights are large, especially for bent-over plumes in which the ascent dynamics are strongly affected by the surrounding wind field. Here we show how uncertainties can be reduced if MER is derived directly from geophysical observations of source dynamics. The combination of infrasound measurements and thermal camera imagery allows for the infrasonic type of source to be constrained (a dipole in this case) and for the plume exit velocity to be calculated (54-142m/s) based on the acoustic signal recorded during the 2010 Eyjafjallaj{\"{o}}kull eruption from 4 to 21 May. Exit velocities are converted into MER using additional information on vent diameter (50±10m) and mixture density (5.4±1.1kg/m3), resulting in an average {\~{}}9×105kg/s MER during the considered period of the eruption. We validate our acoustic-derived MER by using independent measurements of plume heights (Icelandic Meteorological Office radar observations). Acoustically derived MER are converted into plume heights using field-based relationships and a 1D radially averaged buoyant plume theory model using a reconstructed total grain size distribution. We conclude that the use of infrasonic monitoring may lead to important understanding of the plume dynamics and allows for real-time determination of eruption source parameters. This could improve substantially the forecasting of volcano-related hazards, with important implications for civil aviation safety. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper investigates dynamics of a spherical bubble surrounded by a viscoelastic fluid. The purpose of the study is to understand the parameters which control expansion and fragmentation of bubbly magma by decompression. In particular, we focus on which occurs first, fragmentation or expansion. Supposing that rupture of the bubble wall occurs in a critical stress condition, we calculate the change of the bubble radius and tensile stress at the bubble wall for various decompression rates. Conditions in which tensile stress is stored in the shell are represented in terms of dimensionless parameters. The results are interpreted as follows: when magma viscosity is larger than a critical value, and the decompression time is shorter than viscous expansion time, tensile stress is stored before expansion; when magma viscosity is smaller than the critical value, tensile stress is not stored, no matter how rapid the decompression. Although it is a generally accepted theory that fragmentation is effected by stress conditions and decompression time, exactly how decompression time (t1) effects the fragmentation is not yet fully understood. This study demonstrates that the stress condition is controlled by the length of the decompression time not relative to the viscoelastic relaxation time (t1 / ??), but relative to the viscous expansion time (t1 / ??l$\backslash$nrlx). As suggested by recent experimental studies, the decompression time relative to viscoelastic relaxation time (t1 / ??) is also significant to the fragmentation process itself. It indicates that the decompression time effects the fragmentation not through the stress condition. However more work must be completed to fully understand the particular relationship between the decompression time and relaxation time in terms of its influence on fragmentation. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis of seismograms, recorded at a distance of 500 m from one of the three active vents, shows for the first onset a low-frequency and particle motion characteristic of a p-wave, which loses its longitudinal polarization with the onset of the air-wave. Recording the explosion-quakes simultaneously with a microphone we could ascertain that the high-frequency onset coincided with the air-wave's. In order to better understand the seismic wavefield generated by the atmospheric pressure, we performed a controlled source experiment at Stromboli using a seismic gun. Seismograms with the same two phases and particle motions comparable with the volcano-seismic data were obtained. A second experiment demonstrated, that the air-wave propagates at least in the uppermost 1 m of the ground. We suggest that the seismic source of the corresponding seismograms is an explosion at the top of the magma column and conclude that the p- and air-waves are both generated in the same point and at the same time.},

abstract = {Small-aperture array measurements of seismic noise at seven sites around Yasur volcano (Vanuatu) are performed to estimate the V P and V S velocities of the shallow structure. The spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) and the frequency-wavenumber (f-k) methods are used to determine Rayleigh phase velocity dispersion curves. Phase velocities computed with the SPAC method vary between 580m/s and 960m/s at 1Hz and between 270m/s and 420m/s at 15Hz. F-k dispersion curves show velocities of 300-340m/s and 800-940m/s at 1Hz and 200-230m/s at 15Hz. An inversion technique based on the use of the neighbourhood algorithm has been used to calculate the one-dimensional velocity model at each site. Velocity models reach 200m deep and mainly contain two layers and a half-space. For sites close to the Siwi caldera rims, comparisons with geology and hydrothermal system studies suggest that the two layers highlighted in models may correspond to two large pyroclastic sequences related to caldera collapses based on the flank of an old volcano. Results obtained for the other three sites, located inside the caldera, show the influence of the hydrothermal system on P- and S-wave velocities. For these sites, fluid circulation inside the volcanic deposits causes lower velocities at depth. To obtain a near-surface velocity model of the volcanic structure, each 1D velocity model is spatially extrapolated according to the surface geology. Results highlight four distinct areas, the Siwi caldera edges with high velocities and the resurgent block, the ash plain and the Yasur edifice with lower velocities at depth. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Experiment is central to scientific methodology. Within science in general, experiments are used for four primary purposes, i.e. as a tool to explore novel phenomena and to provide systematic observations of processes, to determine the values of key parameters, to test hypotheses and theoretical models, and to validate computational models, which themselves can be considered as numerical experiments. The study of volcanic eruptions and magmatic processes is becoming increasingly systematic, quantitative and rigorous. The drive is towards providing detailed quantitative descriptions and models of the flow phenomena in terms of fundamental physico–chemical processes. This is motivated in no small way by an increasing need for reliable and quantitative predictions of volcanic eruptions on which to base rational hazard and risk management decisions during volcanic crises. A natural consequence of this development of the scientific study of volcanic flow phenomena is that rigorous laboratory experimentation is becoming an increasingly important feature within volcanic research.},

To handle this situation, we proposed robotic observations in a volcanic area after an eruption using a multi-rotor UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and a small ground robot. Field experiments are effective at promoting this type of research and development. Therefore, we performed several field experiments at Mt. Asama.

Active moss bag biomonitoring, an easy to apply and low budget method, was used to determine trace element release from volcanic areas of different geological context and climates. Exposure height variations (0.7–1.6 m above ground) due to different availability of natural tie points did not affect the results. Accumulation was linear for exposure durations from three days to nine weeks, so values were comparable by normalization to moss exposure time. Uncovered moss bags showed higher accumulation than co-exposed covered ones because of additional dust and wet deposition while washout by rain was negligible. The selection of a specific moss significantly affected element accumulation with moss of lower shoot compactness accumulating more. For all volcanic areas, highest accumulation was found for S (1–1000 $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}(g{\textperiodcentered}d)− 1), followed by Fe and Mg (0.1–10 $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}(g{\textperiodcentered}d)− 1), Sr, Ba, Pb, Cr, Li (10− 4–10− 1 $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}(g{\textperiodcentered}d)− 1), then Co, Mo and the volatile elements As, Sb, Se, Tl, Bi (10− 6–10− 2 $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}(g{\textperiodcentered}d)− 1). For most elements, open conduit volcanoes (Etna, Stromboli, Nyiragongo) showed higher moss accumulation rates than more quiescent hydrothermal areas (Vulcano {\textgreater} Nisyros {\textgreater} Yellowstone National Park) and a correlation of S, Fe, and Pb from eruptive ash and lava emissions. For some volatile elements (S, As, Se), higher accumulation was observed within fumarolic fields compared to crater rims of open conduit volcanoes which is a relevant information for risk assessment of tourist exposure to volcanic gases.},

abstract = {The flow dynamics of magmas is controlled by several parameters, including magma rheology, density, surface tension, gas and liquid flow rate, and the geometry of the flow field, which is mainly regulated by the conduit shape. For this reason, magmatic flows along fis-sures and dikes are significantly different from those along axisymmetric conduits. Basaltic eruptions are typically fed by fractures or dike systems that reach the surface, giving rise to fissure eruptions. Scaled experiments show that in these low-viscosity systems, gas transport and segregation (i.e., the outgassing dynamics) are deeply controlled by the fracture geometry. Rapid bubble clustering and formation of bubble plumes determine the formation of lateral magma convection cells involving up to 70 vol{\%} of the melt. In analogy with outgassing in cylindrical conduits, the average vesicularity and size of bubbles increase with increasing gas flow rate and melt viscosity and density, which also control the lateral extent of the bubble plume and convection cells.},

At present, seismic models explaining the origin of the spectral content of the seismic signal are mainly linked to geometrical features of the volcanic conduit and to resonant effects induced by pressure fluctuations in a fluid-filled conduit. Such models assume the physical system to be in a steady state over a long interval of time. At Stromboli, the seismicity produced by each of the three active vents is not stable and can suddenly change in time. Therefore, the application of stable resonator models appears to be unwarranted. On the basis of infrared image analyses, atmospheric pressure, and seismic wavefield signals, we show that different frequency contents and different explosive styles occur at Stromboli at the same time at different vents. Moreover, we give evidence to support the idea that seismicity and explosivity are both controlled by a variable gas flow regime released during explosions at the top of the magma column. We have recognized two main pressure regimes, controlling the explositivity at Stromboli: one is impulsive, short and possibly produced by a gas accumulation beneath a cap rock; the other has an intermittent regime feature, and lasts longer. We demonstrate how the first one generates a monochromatic low-frequency wavefield, while the second shows a high-frequency spectrum where the frequency content depends on pressure fluctuations and on pressure gradient. We suggest different pressure growth and gas flow in the magma as the common source for both explosive style and seismic wavefield.},

abstract = {Long-lived effusive volcanism at the Pu`u `Ō`ō crater complex, Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii produces persistent infrasonic tremor that has been recorded almost continuously for months to years. Previous studies showed that this infrasonic tremor wavefield can be recorded at a range of {\textgreater}10 km. However, the low signal power of this tremor relative to ambient noise levels results in significant propagation effects on signal detectability at this range. In April 2007, we supplemented a broadband infrasound array at ∼12.5 km from Pu`u `Ō`ō (MENE) with a similar array at ∼2.4 km from the source (KIPU). The additional closer-range data enable further evaluation of tropospheric propagation effects and provide higher signal-to-noise ratios for studying volcanic source processes. The infrasonic tremor source appears to consist of at least two separate physical processes. We suggest that bubble cloud oscillation in a roiling magma conduit beneath the crater complex may produce a broadband component of the tremor. Low-frequency sound sourced in a shallow magma conduit may radiate infrasound efficiently into the atmosphere due to the anomalous transparency of the magma-air interface. We further propose that more sharply peaked tones with complex temporal evolution may result from oscillatory interactions of a low-velocity gas jet with solid vent boundaries in a process analogous to the hole tone or whistler nozzle. The infrasonic tremor arrives with a median azimuth of ∼67° at KIPU. Additional infrasonic signals and audible sounds originating from the extended lava tube system to the south of the crater complex (median azimuth ∼77°) coincided with turbulent degassing activity at a new lava tube skylight. Our observations indicate that acoustic studies may aid in understanding persistent continuous degassing and unsteady flow dynamics at Kilauea Volcano.},

abstract = {Partial equilibrium conditions occur between fluids and secondary minerals in the Valles hydrothermal system, contained principally in the Tertiary rhyolitic Bandelier Tuff. The mass transfer processes are governed by reactive phase compositions, surface areas, water-rock ratios, reaction rates, and fluid residence times. Experimental dissolution of the vitric phase of the tuff was congruent with respect to Cl in the solid and produced reaction rates which obeyed a general Arrhenius release rate between 250 and 300??C. The 18O differences between reacted and unreacted rock and fluids, and mass balances calculations involving Cl in the glass phase, produced comparable water-rock ratios of unity, confirming the importance of irreversible reaction of the vitric tuff. A fluid residence time of approximately 2 ?? 103 years, determined from fluid reservoir volume and discharge rates, is less than 0.2{\%} of the total age of the hydrothermal system and denotes a geochemically and isotopically open system. Mass transfer calculations generally replicated observed reservoir pH, Pco2, and PO2 conditions, cation concentrations, and the secondary mineral assemblage between 250 and 300??C. The only extraneous component required to maintain observed calcite saturation and high Pco2 pressures was carbon presumably derived from underlying Paleozoic limestones. Phase rule constraints indicate that Cl was the only incompatible aqueous component not controlled by mineral equilibrium. Concentrations of Cl in the reservoir directly reflect mass transport rates as evidenced by correlations between anomalously high Cl concentrations in the fluids and tuff in the Valles caldera relative to other hydrothermal systems in rhyolitic rocks. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {The 1999 basaltic eruption of Shishaldin volcano (Alaska, USA) displayed both classical Strombolian activity and an explosive Subplinian plume. Strombolian activity at Shishaldin occurred in two major phases following the Subplinian activity. In this paper, we use acoustic measurements to interpret the Strombolian activity. Acoustic measurements of the two Strombolian phases show a series of explosions that are modeled by the vibration of a large overpressurised cylindrical bubble at the top of the magma column. Results show that the bubble does not burst at its maximum radius, as expected if the liquid film is stretched beyond its elasticity. But bursting occurs after one cycle of vibration, as a consequence of an instability of the air-magma interface close to the bubble minimum radius. During each Strombolian period, estimates of bubble length and overpressure are calculated. Using an alternate method based on acoustic power, we estimate gas velocity to be 30-60 m/s, in very good agreement with synthetic waveforms. Although there is some variation within these parameters, bubble length and overpressure for the first Strombolian phase are found to be ??? 82 ?? 11 m and 0.083 MPa. For the second Strombolian phase, bubble length and overpressure are estimated at 24 ?? 12 m and 0.15 MPa for the first 17 h after which bubble overpressure shows a constant increase, reaching a peak of 1.4 MPa, just prior to the end of the second Strombolian phase. This peak suggests that, at the time, the magma in the conduit may contain a relatively large concentration of small bubbles. Maximum total gas volume and gas fluxes at the surface are estimated to be 3.3 ?? 107 and 2.9 ?? 103 m3/s for the first phase and 1.0 ?? 108 and 2.2 ?? 103 m3/s for the second phase. This gives a mass flux of 1.2 ?? 103 and 8.7 ?? 102 kg/s, respectively, for the first and the second Strombolian phases. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Acoustic pressure recorded during several explosions on the Eastern vent of Stromboli volcano, shows a pattern consistent between explosions. The well-marked oscillation contains only very low frequencies (around 7 Hz), and is followed by a signal containing now both higher frequencies and lower frequency (less than 4 Hz). The generation of sound is explained by the vibration (7 Hz) and bursting (higher frequencies) of large bubbles, followed by the drainage of magma down in the conduit (less than 4 Hz). The interpretation suggests that: (1) the bubble vibrates before bursting and (2) the vibration prior to bursting yields more energy than the bursting itself. The radius of bubbles responsible for explosions is determined to be close to 1 meter, in agreement with observations of a few conduit sizes.},

abstract = {Understandings of controlling mechanism on the style of volcanic explosion is one of the most important subject not only for volcanology but also for hazard mitigation. Vesiculation, outgassing and crystallization of magma, and interaction with external water have been considered as essential factors for the controlling mechanism (e.g., Houghton and Gonnerman, 2005). In contrast, recent studies suggested that vigorous recyclings of pyroclast into the vent occur at basaltic volcanoes with repeating small explosions (D'Oriano et al., 2014). The recycling of pyroclast that fills the shallow conduit can affect explosion dynamics such as shape and ejection speed of jet cloud (e.g., Ohba et al., 2002). This study examined component, texture and chemical composition of ash samples collected during normal activity at Stromboli to discuss a controlling mechanism of small explosion styles in basaltic volcano. During studied term (14:26-18:29, May 21th, 2014), ash-rich explosion occurred in NE crater, and ash-poor explosion occurred in the central and SW craters. We performed real-time collection of falling ash every 4-18 minutes. The real-time collection permits direct comparison of the ash samples with explosion activity. We classify the ash particles into Juvenile (glassy particles having similar composition with HP magma), Recycled (similar texture with reheated basaltic ash; D'Oriano et al., 2013), Altered, and Crystal particles. Bulk component of recycled particle calculated from componentry variations with grain size and grain size distribution shows that the volume fraction of recycled particles increases with ash falling rate at sampling site. The ash falling rate at sampling site increased after the occurrence of ash rich explosions at NE crater. Our ash observation indicates that burial of eruptive vent by recycled pyroclasts relates with occurrence of ash rich explosion at NE crater. Therefore, we suggest that combination of the amount of gas supplied from a deeper conduit and thickness of the buried sediment in the vent controls the style of small basaltic explosion in Stromboli (Burton et al., 2007; Patrick et al., 2007; Quane et al., 2009). Depositional structure of the vent determined by the pyroclast recycling and history of the explosions are important for understanding the explosion styles.},

abstract = {Previous experimental studies have revealed that the difference in diffusivity of two isotopes can be significant in some media and can lead to an observable fractionation effect in silicate melts based on isotope mass. Here, we report the first characterization of the difference in diffusivities of stable isotopes of Cl (35Cl and37Cl). Using a piston–cylinder apparatus, we generated quenched melts of dacitic composition enriched in Cl; from these we fabricated diffusion couples in which Cl atoms were induced to diffuse in a chemical gradient at 1200 to 1350 °C and 1 GPa. We analyzed the run products by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for their isotopic compositions along the diffusion profiles, and we report a diffusivity ratio for37Cl/35Cl of 0.995±0.001 ($\beta$=0.09±0.02). No significant effect of temperature on the diffusivity ratio was discernable over the 150 °C range covered by our experiments. The observed 0.5{\%} difference in diffusivity of the two isotopes could affect our interpretation of isotopic measurements of Cl isotopes in bubble-bearing or degassed magmas, because bubble growth is regulated in part by the diffusive supply of volatiles to the bubble from the surrounding melt. Through numerical simulations, we constrain the extent of Cl isotopic fractionation between bubble and host melt during this process. Bubble growth rates vary widely in nature—which implies a substantial range in the expected magnitude of isotopic fractionation—but plausible growth scenarios lead to Cl isotopic fractionations up to about 5‰ enrichment of35Cl relative to37Cl in the bubble. This effect should be considered when interpreting Cl isotopic measurements of systems that have experienced vapor exsolution.},

abstract = {Volcanoes emit larger amounts of volcanic gas than can be dissolved in the volume of erupted magma during a variety of volcanic processes, including explosive and effusive eruption and noneruptive continuous degassing. Degassing of unerupted magma with a much larger volume than that of erupted magma caused such a large degassing; erupted magma represents only a small portion of the magma that drives volcanic activity. Evaluation of the magma-gas differentiation process causing the excess degassing is necessary to understand eruption processes, magma chamber evolution, and crustal growth by magma intrusion. Three mechanisms are proposed to explain various degassing modes, including eruption of bubble-accumulated magma, degassing of a convecting magma column, and permeable gas transportation from a deep magma chamber. Examples of large degassing in excess of the erupted magma are common in subduction zone volcanism but are rare in rift- and hot spot–associated volcanism.},

If fragments fall back within the crater area before being re-ejected during the ensuing activity, they are subject to thermally- and chemically-induced alterations. These 'recycled' clasts can be considered as cognate lithic for the eruption/explosion they derive. Their exact identification has consequences for a correct interpretation of eruption dynamics, with important implications for hazard assessment. On ash erupted during selected basaltic eruptions (at Stromboli, Etna, Vesuvius, Gaua-Vanuatu), we have identified a set of characteristics that can be associated with the occurrence of intra-crater recycling processes, based also on the comparison with results of reheating experiments performed on primary juvenile material, at variable temperature and under different redox conditions.},

abstract = {After ash-dominated Strombolian eruption, considerable amount of ash falls back to the volcanic conduit. By the fallback ash, the formation of a dense near-surface region is expected because it is compacted by weights of its own and other fallback clasts. The dense cap causes the gas pressure inside the conduit to increase, which promotes a forthcoming eruption. Under such conditions, the rheology of the fallback ash plays an important role in this cyclical eruption mechanism. However, little attention has been given to the point. We examined the rheology of ash collected at Stromboli volcano via intermittent compression experiments changing temperature and compression time/rate. The elastic modulus, the viscosity, and the relaxation time were estimated by a viscoelastic Maxwell model. The results show that the elasticity and the viscosity dominantly depend on the compression rate and the temperature respectively, although both of them vary with time. Thus, the ash behaves either elastically or viscously depending on the external conditions and time. The viscoelastic characteristics can be explained by magnitude relationships between the characteristic relaxation time and times for compression and rest processes. This indicates that the balance of the time scales is key to determining the rheological characteristics.},

abstract = {Stromboli is known for its mild, persistent explosive activity from the vents located within the summit crater depression at the uppermost part of the Sciara del Fuoco (SdF) depression. Effusive activity (lava flows) at this volcano normally occurs every 5-15 years, involving often the opening of eruptive fissures along the SdF, and more rarely overflows from the summit crater. Between the end of the 2007 effusive eruption and December 2012, the number of lava flows inside and outside the crater depression has increased significantly, reaching a total of 28, with an average of 4.8 episodes per year. An open question is why this activity has become so frequent during the last 6 years and was quite rare before. In this paper, we describe this exceptional activity and propose an interpretation based on the structural state of the volcano, changed after the 2002-2003 and even more after the 2007 flank effusive eruption. We use images from the Stromboli fixed cameras network, as well as ground photos, plume SO2 and CO2 fluxes released by the summit crater, and continuous fumarole temperature recording, to unravel the interplay between magma supply, structural and morphology changes, and lava flow output. Our results might help forecast the future behaviour and hazard at Stromboli and might be applicable to other open-conduit volcanoes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Analysis of regional data recorded at the IMS array IS44 in southern Kamchatka, {\~{}} 384 km from the vent focuses on the eruption onset in November 2012, while analysis of local data focuses on activity in February and August 2013. Signals recorded from Tolbachik suggest a change in eruptive intensity possibly occurred from November 27-30, 2012. Local infrasound data recorded at distances of 100-950 m from the vent are characterized primarily by repeated, transient explosion signals indicative of gas slug bursts. Three methods are employed to pick slug burst events in February and August. The nature of slug bursts makes a monopole acoustic source model particularly fitting, permitting volume outflux and slug radius calculations for individual events. Volume outfluxes and slug radii distributions provide three possible explanations for the eruption style of Tolbachik Volcano from mid-February to late August. Cumulative outflux for slug bursts (i.e. mass of emissions from individual bursts) derived by infrasound for both February and August range from {\textless} 100 to {\~{}} 3000 kg. These values are greater than infrasound-derived emissions calculated at Pacaya Volcano, but less than those calculated at Mt. Erebus Volcano. From this, we determine slug bursts at Tolbachik Volcano in February and August were larger on average than those at Pacaya Volcano in 2010, but smaller on average than those at Mt. Erebus in 2008. Our overall emissions estimates are in general agreement with estimates from satellite observations. This agreement supports the monopole source inversion as a potential method for estimating mass of emissions from slug burst events.},

abstract = {Probabilistic characterizations of possible future eruptive scenarios at Vesuvius volcano are elaborated and organized within a risk-based framework. In the EXPLORIS project, a wide variety of topics relating to this basic problem have been pursued: updates of historical data, reinterpretation of previous geological field data and the collection of new fieldwork results, the development of novel numerical modelling codes and of risk assessment techniques have all been completed. To achieve coherence, many diverse strands of evidence had to be unified within a formalised structure, and linked together by expert knowledge. For this purpose, a Vesuvius 'Event Tree' (ET) was created to summarise in a numerical-graphical form, at different levels of detail, all the relative likelihoods relating to the genesis and style of eruption, development and nature of volcanic hazards, and the probabilities of occurrence of different volcanic risks in the next eruption crisis. The Event Tree formulation provides a logical pathway connecting generic probabilistic hazard assessment to quantitative risk evaluation. In order to achieve a complete parameterization for this all-inclusive approach, exhaustive hazard and risk models were needed, quantified with comprehensive uncertainty distributions for all factors involved, rather than simple 'best-estimate' or nominal values. Thus, a structured expert elicitation procedure was implemented to complement more traditional data analysis and interpretative approaches. The structure of the Vesuvius Event Tree is presented, and some of the data analysis findings and elicitation outcomes that have provided initial indicative probability distributions to be associated with each of its branches are summarized. The Event Tree extends from initiating volcanic eruption events and hazards right through to human impact and infrastructure consequences, with the complete tree and its parameterisation forming a quantitative synoptic framework for comprehensive hazard evaluation and mapping of risk impacts. The organization of the Event Tree allows easy updating, as and when new information becomes available. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Volcanic tremor is a ubiquitous feature of explosive eruptions. This oscillation persists for minutes to weeks and is characterized by a remarkably narrow band of frequencies from about 0.5 Hz to 7 Hz (refs 1-4). Before major eruptions, tremor can occur in concert with increased gas flux and related ground deformation. Volcanic tremor is thus of particular value for eruption forecasting. Most models for volcanic tremor rely on specific properties of the geometry, structure and constitution of volcanic conduits as well as the gas content of the erupting magma. Because neither the initial structure nor the evolution of the magma-conduit system will be the same from one volcano to the next, it is surprising that tremor characteristics are so consistent among different volcanoes. Indeed, this universality of tremor properties remains a major enigma. Here we employ the contemporary view that silicic magma rises in the conduit as a columnar plug surrounded by a highly vesicular annulus of sheared bubbles. We demonstrate that, for most geologically relevant conditions, the magma column will oscillate or 'wag' against the restoring 'gas-spring' force of the annulus at observed tremor frequencies. In contrast to previous models, the magma-wagging oscillation is relatively insensitive to the conduit structure and geometry, which explains the narrow band of tremor frequencies observed around the world. Moreover, the model predicts that as an eruption proceeds there will be an upward drift in both the maximum frequency and the total signal frequency bandwidth, the nature of which depends on the explosivity of the eruption, as is often observed.},

abstract = {[1] Fragmentation of vesicular magma by rapid decompression is one of the most likely triggers for explosive eruptions. In this phenomenon the decompression rate and the viscoelastic nature of magma are considered to be key factors. In order to obtain a clear idea on the effects of these two factors, controlled fragmentation experiments have been conducted. These experiments have three advantages. First, the specimen is made of a viscoelastic material with controlled porosity and geometry. Second, the fragmentation process is directly monitored. Finally, both the magnitude and rate of decompression are controlled. Brittle fragmentation and ductile expansion were both observed in the same porous material at different timescales. The various mechanical responses of the specimen (elastic, flow, and fragmentation) were correlated with the pressure profile measured at the base of the specimen. Fragmentation was noted to occur when the decompression exceeded a critical value within a critical time. Two relevant timescales are discussed in terms of physical mechanisms of relaxation. The first is the measured glass transition time. The second is the estimated timescale for the onset of viscous bubble expansion. The observed phenomena bear several similarities with natural magma fragmentation. It is thus considered that the present results are a useful step toward constructing a model for magma fragmentation.},

abstract = {The ascent of large gas bubbles (slugs) in vertical cylindrical conduits and low-viscosity magmas is simulated using 1D mathematical and 3D computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models. Following laboratory evidence, the 1D model defines a constant rise velocity for the slug base and allows gas expansion to accelerate the slug nose through the overlying fluid during ascent. The evolution of rapidly expanding gas slugs observed in laboratory experiments is reproduced well and, at volcano scales, predicts at-surface overpressures of several atmospheres without requiring any initial overpressure at depth. The near-surface dynamics increase slug nose velocities through the overlying magma by a factor of c. 2.5 and the gas expansion results in pre-burst magma surface velocities of c. 35 m s−1. To examine pressure distributions and the forces exerted on a conduit, 3D CFD simulations were carried out. At volcano scales, the vertical single forces during final slug ascent to the surface are c. 106 N, two orders of magnitude smaller than those associated with very-long-period seismic events at Stromboli. This supports a previous interpretation of these events in which they are generated by gas slugs flowing through changes in conduit geometry, rather than being the direct result of slug eruption processes.},

abstract = {Stromboli is an open conduit volcano characterized by persistent conduit degassing and explosive dynamics. During the 2003 effusive eruption we monitored this activity with a five-element array deployed at similar to 450 m from the active craters. The array allows us to track in real time changes of explosive activity in terms of source position and excess pressure release. Infrasonic monitoring located the new active vents in the same preeruptive position, revealing that the collapse of the crater terrace has not changed the geometry of the shallow feeding system. Elevation of the infrasonic source is stable at similar to 750 m above sea level, coincident with the elevation of the crater terrace. This suggests a shallow position of the magma column or, if the source is embedded in the conduit, diffraction at the crater rim. At the end of the eruption, back azimuth analysis indicates that explosive activity was progressively reestablished at all of the craters following a NE toward SW direction along the collapsed trench. The array detected significant small-amplitude similar to 1 Pa) infrasonic activity occurring at a rate of approximately one pulse every 2 s and generally located in only one vent at a time. This persistent activity is not related to Strombolian explosion, but we infer it is reflecting the overpressurized degassing of the magma column. Amplitude distribution of similar to 7 million infrasonic signals shows that this degassing is 1 order of magnitude more energetic than the explosions. Besides, infrasonic amplitude distribution presents a decay with a double slope, indicating that explosions and degassing are driven by conduit dynamics acting at two different rates.},

@article{Rosi1993,
abstract = {The eruption of 1631 A.D. was the most violent and destructive event in the recent history of Vesuvius. More than fifty primary documents, written in either Italian or Latin, were critically examined, with preference given to the authors who eyewitnessed volcanic phenomena. The eruption started at 7 a.m. on December 16 with the formation of an eruptive column and was followed by block and lapilli fallout east and northeast of the volcano until 6 p.m. of the same day. At 10 a.m. on December 17, several nu{\'{e}}es ardentes were observed to issue from the central crater, rapidly descending the flanks of the cone and devastating the villages at the foot of Vesuvius. In the night between the 16th and 17th and on the afternoon of the 17th, extensive lahars and floods, resulting from rainstorms, struck the radial valleys of the volcano as well as the plain north and northeast. Deposits of the eruption were identified in about 70 localities on top of an ubiquitous paleosol formed during a long preeruptive volcanic quiescence. The main tephra unit consists of a plinian fallout composed of moderately vesicular dark green lapilli, crystals and lithics. Isopachs of the fallout are elongated eastwards and permit a conservative volume calculation of 0.07 km3. The peak mass flux deduced from clast dispersal models is estimated in the range 3-6 × 107 kg/s, corresponding to a column height of 17-21 km. East of the volcano the plinian fallout is overlain by ash-rich low-grade ignimbrite, surges, phreatomagmatic ashes and mud flows. Ash flows occur in paleovalleys around the cone of Vesuvius but are lacking on the Somma side, suggesting that pyroclastic flows had not enough energy to overpass the caldera wall of Mt. Somma. Deposits are generally unconsolidated, massive with virtually no ground layer and occasionally bearing sparse rests of charred vegetation. Past interpretations of the products emitted on the morning of December 17 as lava flows are inconsistent with both field observations and historical data. Features of the final phreatomagmatic ashes are suggestive of alternating episodes of wet ash fallout and rainfalls. Lahars interfingered with primary ash fallout confirm episodes of massive remobilization of loose tephra by heavy rainfalls during the final stage of the eruption. Chemical analyses of scoria clasts suggest tapping of magma from a compositionally zoned reservoir. Leucite-bearing, tephritic-phonolite (SiO2 51.17{\%}) erupted in the early plinian phase was in fact followed by darker and slightly more mafic magma richer in crystals (SiO2 49.36{\%}). During the nu{\'{e}}es ardentes phase the composition returned to that of the early phase of the eruption. The reconstruction of the 1631 eruptive scenario supplies new perspectives on the hazards related to plinian eruptions of Vesuvius. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

In the present work, we have experimentally as well as computationally studied the effect of gas velocity, sparger design and coalescence suppressing additives on dynamics of gas-liquid flow in a rectangular bubble column. Wall pressure fluctuations were measured to characterize the low frequency oscillations of the meandering bubble plume. Bubble size distribution measurements were carried out using high-speed digital camera. Dispersed gas-liquid flow in bubble column was modelled using Eulerian-Eulerian approach. Bubble population was represented in the model with a single group or multiple groups. Bubble coalescence and break-up processes were included in the multi-group simulations via a suitable population balance framework. Effect of superficial gas velocity and sparger configurations was studied using single-group simulations. Model predictions were verified by comparison with the experimental data. Role of bubble size in determining plume oscillation period was studied. Multi-group simulations were carried out to examine evolution of bubble size distribution. An attempt is made to understand the relationship between local and global (over all the dispersion volume) bubble size distribution. The models and results reported here would be useful to develop and to extend the applications of multi-group CFD models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Vergniolle1990,
abstract = {At Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, the recent long-lived eruptions of Mauna Ulu and Pu'u O'o have occurred in two major stages, defining a characteristic eruptive pattern. The first stage consists of cyclic changes of activity between episodes of “fire fountaining” and periods of quiescence or effusion of vesicular lava. The second stage consists only of continuous effusion of lava. We suggest that these features reflect the dynamics of magma degassing in a chamber which empties into a narrow conduit. In the volcano chamber, gas bubbles rise through magma and accumulate at the roof in a foam layer. The foam flows toward the conduit, and its shape is determined by a dynamic balance between the input of bubbles from below and the output into the conduit. The foam thickness is proportional to ($\mu$l Q/$\epsilon$2 $\rho$lg)1/4, where $\mu$ l and $\rho$ l are the viscosity and density of magma, $\epsilon$ is the gas volume fraction in the foam, g is the acceleration of gravity, and Q is the gas flux. The bubbles in the foam deform under the action of buoyancy, and the maximum permissible foam thickness is h c = 2$\sigma$/$\epsilon$$\rho$ l {\{}gR{\}}, where $\sigma$ is the coefficient of surface tension and R is the original bubble radius. If this critical thickness is reached, the foam collapses into a large gas pocket which erupts into the conduit. Foam accumulation then resumes, and a new cycle begins. The attainment of the foam collapse threshold requires a gas flux in excess of a critical value which depends on viscosity, surface tension, and bubble size. Hence two different eruption regimes are predicted: (1) alternating regimes of foam buildup and collapse leading to the periodic eruption of large gas volumes and (2) steady foam flow at the roof leading to continuous bubbly flow in the conduit. The essential result is that the continuous process of degassing can lead to discontinuous eruptive behavior. Data on eruption rates and repose times between fountaining phases from the 1969 Mauna {\{}UIu{\}} and the 1983–1986 Pu'u O'o eruptions yield constraints on three key variables. The area of the chamber roof must be a few tens of square kilometers, with a minimum value of about 8 km2. Magma reservoirs of similar dimensions are imaged by seismic attenuation tomography below the east rift zone. Close to the roof, the gas volume fraction is a few percent, and the gas bubbles have diameters lying between 0.1 and 0.6 mm. These estimates are close to the predictions of models for bubble nucleation and growth in basaltic melts, as well as to the observations on deep submarine basalts. The transition between cyclic and continuous activity occurs when the mass flux of gas becomes lower than a critical value of the order of 103 kg/s. In this model, changes of eruptive regime reflect changes in the amount and size of bubbles which reach the chamber roof.},

abstract = {In order to put constraints on the mechanisms of compositional zonation in magma chambers, data were collected on caldera areas, ash-flow volumes and repose times between zoned ash flows for a number of magmatic systems of different age, composition, size and tectonic environment. First-order correlations between volume, repose time and stratification rate are apparent. Chemical zonation is developed to partially compensate for the internal production of entropy due to heat conduction through magma chamber thermal boundary layers. Repose times are proportional to eruption volumes and are consistent with convection-aided diffusion processes such as Soret diffusion or double-diffusive convection. Volume and area relations suggest that small-volume systems tend to be more conical than cylindrical in shape. An important factor controlling magma chamber evolution appears to be the ratio of magma chamber surface area to magma chamber volume, other factors remaining the same. Small magma chambers appear to stratify in shorter periods of time and at faster rates than large-volume systems. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Although it is relatively easy to set-up, the monitoring of soil temperature in sub-fumarolic areas is quite rarely used to monitor the evolution of hydrothermal systems. Indeed, measurements are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, in particular daily and seasonal variations of atmospheric temperatures and rainfalls, which can be only partially filtered by the established statistical analysis. In this paper, we develop two innovative processing methods, both based on the computation of the heat flux in the soil. The upward heat flux method (UHF), designed for dry environments, consists in computing both the conductive and convective components of the heat flux between two thermocouples placed vertically. In the cases of wet environments, the excess of total heat method (ETH) allows the integration of rain gauges data in order to correct the heat balance from the superficial cooling effect of the precipitations. The performances of both processing techniques are faced to established methods (temperature gradient and coefficient of determination) on soil temperature time series from two test volcanoes. At La Fossa di Vulcano (Italy), the UHF method undoubtedly detects three thermal crises between 2009 and 2012, enabling to quantify not only the intensity but also the precise timing of the heat flux increase with respect to corresponding geochemical and seismic crises. At La Soufri{\`{e}}re de Guadeloupe (French Lesser Antilles), despite large rainfalls dramatically influencing the thermal behavior of the soil, a constant geothermal heat flux is retrieved by the ETH method, confirming the absence of fumarolic crisis during the observation period (February–August 2010). Being quantitative, robust, and usable in almost any context of sub-fumarolic zones, our two heat flux-based methods increase the potential of soil temperature for the monitoring, but also the general interpretation of fumarolic crises together with geochemical and seismological observations. A spreadsheet allowing direct computation of UHF and ETH is provided as supplemental material.},

abstract = {Between 2007 and early 2008, the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) monitoring networks on Etna volcano recorded a recharging phase that climaxed with a new effusive eruption on 13 May 2008 and lasted about 14 months. A dike-forming intrusion was accompanied by a violent seismic swarm, with more than 230 events recorded in the first 6 h, the largest being M L = 3.9. In the meanwhile, marked ground deformation was recorded by the permanent tilt and GPS networks, and sudden changes in the summit area were detected by five continuously recording magnetic stations. Poor weather conditions did not allow direct observation of the eruptive events, but important information was provided by infrared satellite images that detected the start of lava fountains from the eruptive fissure, feeding a lava flow. This flow spread within the Valle del Bove depression, covering 6.4 km on the southeastern flank of the volcano in a few hours. The seismicity and deformation pattern indicated that the dike-forming intrusion was propagating northward. It produced a dry fracture field, which generated concern for the possibility that the eruptive fissures could expand downslope toward populated areas. Monitoring and modeling of the multidisciplinary data, together with the simulations of ash dispersal and lava flows, allowed us both to infer the eruptive mechanisms and to provide correct interpretation of the ongoing phenomena, furnishing useful information for civil defense purposes. We describe how this approach of feedback between monitoring and research provides critical support to risk evaluation.},

We present new geophysical constraints on the shallow feeding system of Etna volcano derived from array analysis of infrasound radiated from two distinct sources, one located in the SE crater and one in the Voragine or NE crater (VNE). These two sources alternated in their behavior, with the VNE crater system radiating low amplitude background infrasound interrupted by episodes of increased infrasound radiation from the SE crater. This switching behavior suggested a branched shallow feeding system strongly controlled by the gas/magma-flux. Here, the VNE craters represented the preferential and most stable branch of degassing during stationary flux regime, while the SE crater branch activated in response to an increase in the magma/gas supply rate.

Here we use DNA expression arrays to examine whether gene-expression profiles in two populations evolved in parallel, which would indicate adaptation, and to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying their adaptation. We compared the expression profile of the ancestor to that of clones sampled from both populations after 20,000 generations. The expression of 59 genes had changed significantly in both populations. Remarkably, all 59 were changed in the same direction relative to the ancestor. Many of these genes were members of the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) regulons. Sequencing of several genes controlling the effectors of these regulons found a nonsynonymous mutation in in one population. Moving this mutation into the ancestral background showed that it increased fitness and produced many of the expression changes manifest after 20,000 generations. The same mutation had no effect on fitness when introduced into the other evolved population, indicating that a mutation of similar effect was present already. Our study demonstrates the utility of expression arrays for addressing evolutionary issues including the quantitative measurement of parallel evolution in independent lineages and the identification of beneficial mutations.},

abstract = {White Island volcano, New Zealand, produced two periods (January–February and July 2013) of episodic and persistent eruptions through a viscous shallow mud/sulphur pool. The eruptions included an initial hemispherical bubble burst, which was intermittently followed by an up-channel gas jet, and finally a late stage heaving of a mud/sulphur/water suspension. The late stage heave was systematically directed south-eastward as far as 30–40m from the vent. The associated infrasound time-series included harmonic tremor on permanent stations WIZ and WSRZ. Detailed inspection showed that the tremor was composed of numerous discrete double pulse events without a strong periodic event repetition. The first pulse had highly similar waveforms event-to-event and a notable distortion of the waveform period between the two infrasound stations located on opposites sides from the directed eruption source. The second pulse occurred about 1.5–2.5s later and was weakly observed on station WSRZ. Where the video can be rigorously linked to the double pulse infrasound signals we interpret aspects of the distinctive eruptive regimes. For this case, the regime dynamics are driven by the propagation of numerous discrete gas slugs though the shallow viscous muddy crater lake, each generating a distinct bubble burst with subsequent eruption heave and associated double pulse infrasound events. The double pulse events are the source of the persistent harmonic tremor having fundamental and overtone spectral frequencies but are not interpreted as related to harmonic resonance or a repetitious comb function. Instead the activity is produced by a single event producing a specific two pulse source time function. The observed distortion in the first pulse wave period at WIZ and WSRZ may be ascribed to a Doppler shift associated with the directivity observed in the initial jet/heave eruption process. We surmise that double pulse source dynamics and directivity effects may be generically extended to some examples of subsurface seismic tremor or for tremor associated with geyser eruptions, mud volcano eruptions, fire fountains from lava lakes and strombolian eruptions.},

@article{Nakada1999a,
abstract = {Following 198 years of dormancy, a small phreatic eruption started at the summit of Unzen Volcano (Mt. Fugen) in November 1990. A swarm of volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes had begun below the western flank of the volcano a year before this eruption, and isolated tremor occurred below the summit shortly before it. The focus of VT events had migrated eastward to the summit and became shallower. Following a period of phreatic activity, phreatomagmatic eruptions began in February 1991, became larger with time, and developed into a dacite dome eruption in May 1991 that lasted approximately 4 years. The emergence of the dome followed inflation, demagnetization and a swarm of high-frequency (HF) earthquakes in the crater area. After the dome appeared, activity of the VT earthquakes and the summit HF events was replaced largely by low-frequency (LF) earthquakes. Magma was discharged nearly continuously through the period of dome growth, and the rate decreased roughly with time. The lava dome grew in an unstable form on the shoulder of Mt. Fugen, with repeating partial collapses. The growth was exogenous when the lava effusion rate was high, and endogenous when low. A total of 13 lobes grew as a result of exogenous growth. Vigorous swarms of LF earthquakes occurred just prior to each lobe extrusion. Endogenous growth was accompanied by strong deformation of the crater floor and HF and LF earthquakes. By repeated exogenous and endogenous growth, a large dome was formed over the crater. Pyroclastic flows frequently descended to the northeast, east, and southeast, and their deposits extensively covered the eastern slope and flank of Mt. Fugen. Major pyroclastic flows took place when the lava effusion rate was high. Small vulcanian explosions were limited in the initial stage of dome growth. One of them occurred following collapse of the dome. The total volume of magma erupted was 2.1 x 108m3(dense-rock-equivalent); about a half of this volume remained as a lava dome at the summit (1.2 km long, 0.8 km wide and 230-540 m high). The eruption finished with extrusion of a spin endogenous dome top. Several monitoring results convinced us that the eruption had come to an end: the minimal levels of both seismicity and rockfalls, no discharge of magma, the minimal SO2flux, and cessation of subsidence of the western flank of the volcano. The dome started slow deformation and cooling after the halt of magma effusion in February 1995.},

abstract = {Volcano infrasound is an increasingly useful technique for detecting, locating, characterizing, and quantifying eruptive activity, and can be used to constrain eruption source parameters. In recent years, studies of infrasound data from active volcanoes have shown clear progress towards mitigating volcanic hazards and understanding volcanic source processes. Volcano acoustic sources are shallow or aerial, thus volcano infrasound data provide valuable information on eruption dynamics and are readily combined with direct and remote observations of gas, ash, and other eruptive phenomena. The infrasound signals produced by volcanoes are indicative of the eruption style and dynamics. Here we review the diversity of infrasound signals generated by a wide variety of volcanic eruptions, from hawaiian to plinian, and the physical processes inferred to produce them. We place particular emphasis on regional (15-250. km distance) and global ({\textgreater}250 km distance) volcano infrasound studies, as recent work in this area has made significant advances in monitoring and characterizing remote and difficult-to-monitor eruptions. Long-range infrasonic detection of explosive volcanic eruptions is possible due to the energetic source mechanisms involved, minor atmospheric attenuation at low frequencies, and the existence of waveguides in the atmosphere. However, accurate characterization of the atmosphere and its spatiotemporal variability is required for reliable long-range sound propagation modeling and correct interpretation of global infrasound recordings. Conversely, because volcanic explosions are energetic and sometimes repetitive infrasound sources, they can be used to validate atmospheric and acoustic propagation models. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Analogue modelling has been used, in geological research, since the XIX centur y. Today, both in scientific investigation and in teaching, it is viewed as an indispensable tool in the reconstruction of ongoing geological phenomena, as well as it is fundamental to infer geological processes that happened throughout Earth's History. Considering that analogue modelling can be used as a teaching strategy, when teaching Geology or any other experimental science, it is relevant to define the concept and to reveal its applications and vantages. As it reconstructs and explains past phenomena through the establishment of cause -effect relations with today's analogue phenomena, analogue modelling became an important methodology in the construction of geological knowledge. This line of thinking has been used, for long, by geologists and, when transferred to the cl assroom, it can deepen the understanding of Geology. In order to do so, teachers need to plan and test carefully these activities, which usually i nclude other teaching strategies simultaneously. These activities promote student's involvement in their learning, therefore developing multiple ski lls. The genesis of a mountain range has always been a central issue for Manki nd, in general, and for Geologists, i n particular. Therefore, as Geology Theories about this matter have evolved, so have evolved the modelling techniques and, consequentl y, the teachers should adjust these methodologies in the classroom. Here is presented a new didactic analogue model of (segments of) mountain building adapted from updated scientific models. It was applied in a Geology class with 12 th grade students. This preliminary study showed that analogue modelling helped them to reconstruct their mental models about a contextualized episode of regional Geology.},

One can wonder which pieces of information they can get from such acoustic measurements. For a didactic purpose, we provide also the reader with all the theoretical background necessary for the understanding of the physical processes that govern the various characteristics of the acoustic signals: the cavity geometry governs the frequency; the viscous dissipation and the radiation are responsible for the damping; the acoustic energy informs about the characteristic time associated with the film-rupture more than about the energy initially loaded in the cavity.},

abstract = {Silicic volcanism seems chaotic: the styles, magnitudes, and/or timing of successive eruptions may be without apparent pattern, or patterns may merge, fade, or abruptly change. However, geophysical monitoring of recent eruptions shows that some silicic volcanoes can exhibit cyclic eruptive behavior wherein periods of explosive activity or rapid extrusion alternate with periods of repose. The cycles are commonly observed in time-averaged amplitudes of eruption-related seismicity and also have been observed in ground-surface tilt data. When tilt and seismicity are both observed during oscillatory behavior, as at Soufriere Hills volcano on Montserrat, British West Indies, they correlate in time. Cycle periods range from hours to days, and cycle amplitudes and waveforms vary widely. Complex oscillatory behavior is also sometimes observed during high-pressure (tens of MPa) extrusion of industrial polymer melts. With this phenomenon as a guide, we construct a simple dynamic model for the oscillatory behavior of erupting volcanoes. We propose that cyclic eruptions result from Newtonian flow of compressible magma through the volcanic conduit combined with a stick-slip condition along the conduit wall, in analogy to the behavior of industrial polymers. If magma is forced into the conduit at a constant rate, pressure and flow rate rise. If the flow rate through the conduit exceeds a threshold value, the flow resistance abruptly drops as the magma slips along a shallow portion of the conduit wall. This reduces resistance to flow and causes the flow rate to jump to a higher value. If this enhanced flow rate exceeds the supply rate, both pressure and flow rate decline as the compressed magma in the conduit expands. Eventually slip ceases as the magma reattaches to the conduit wall at a flow rate less than the supply rate. Consequently pressure begins to increase, and the cycle begins again. This simple model reconciles a variety of disparate phenomena associated with cyclic silicic volcanism and provides a paradigm to interpret cyclic eruptive behavior.},

abstract = {With the emergence of portable broadband seismic instrumentation, availability of digital networks with wide dynamic range, and development of new powerful analysis techniques made possible by greatly increased computer capacity, volcano seismology has now reached a mature stage where insights are rapidly being gained on the role played by magmatic and hydrothermal fluids in the generation of seismic waves. Volcanoes produce a wide variety of signals originating in the transport of magma and related hydrothermal fluids and their interaction with solid rock. Typical signals include (1) brittle failure earthquakes that reflect the response of the rock to stress changes induced by magma movement; (2) pressure oscillations accompanying the dynamics of liquids and gases in conduits and cracks; and (3) magma fracturing and fragmentation. Oscillatory behaviors within magmatic and hydrothermal systems are the norm and are the expressions of the complex rheologies of these fluids and nonlinear characteristics of associated processes underlying the release of thermo-chemical and gravitational energy from volcanic fluids along their ascent path. The interpretation of these signals and quantification of their source mechanisms form the core of modern volcano seismology. The accuracy to which the forces operating at the source can be resolved depends on the degree of resolution achieved for the volcanic structure. High-resolution tomography based on iterative inversions of seismic travel-time data can image three-dimensional structures at a scale of a few hundred meters provided adequate local short-period earthquake data are available. Hence, forces in a volcano are potentially resolvable for periods longer than {\~{}}. 1. s. In concert with techniques aimed at the interpretation of processes occurring in the fluid, novel seismic methods have emerged that are allowing the detection of stress changes in volcanic structures induced by magma movement. These methods include (1) ambient noise interferometry, in which the ambient seismic noise is used to probe temporal changes in volcanic structures; (2) the measurement of seismic anisotropy, where changes in the alignment of fluid-filled microcracks and pore space are monitored to assess the response of the crust to pressurization of a magmatic system; and (3) the detection of systematic changes in fault plane solutions of volcano-tectonic earthquakes caused by local stress perturbations during conduit pressurization. As new seismic methods refine our understanding of seismic sources and behavior of volcanic structures, we face new challenges in elucidating the physico-chemical processes that cause volcanic unrest and its seismic and gas-discharge manifestations. Future important goals toward meeting those challenges must include a better understanding of the key types of magma movement, degassing and boiling events that produce characteristic seismic phenomena, along with a quantitative understanding of multiphase fluid behavior under dynamic volcanic conditions. Realizing these goals will be essential for the development of an integrated model of volcanic behavior and will require multidisciplinary research involving detailed field measurements, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling. ?? 2012 .},

abstract = {The dynamics of eruption clouds in explosive volcanic eruptions are governed by entrainment of ambient air into eruption clouds by turbulent mixing. We develop a new numerical pseudo gas model of an eruption cloud by employing three-dimensional coordinates, a third-order accuracy scheme, and a fine grid size in order to investigate the behavior of entrainment due to turbulent mixing. The quantitative features of entrainment are measured by a proportionality constant relating the inflow velocity at the edge of the flow to the average vertical velocity (i.e., the entrainment coefficient). Our model has successfully reproduced the quantitative features of entrainment observed in the laboratory experiments as well as fundamental features of the dynamics of eruption clouds, such as the generation of eruption columns and/or pyroclastic flows. The value of the entrainment coefficient for eruption clouds is estimated from the column height and critical condition for column collapse by comparing results of our model with those of previous one-dimensional models. It is suggested that the value of the entrainment coefficient for an eruption cloud is approximately constant, although the value estimated from the critical condition for column collapse (k ∼ 0.07) is slightly smaller than that based on the column height (k ∼ 0.1). This difference reflects the vertical change of flow structure in the eruption cloud. The eruption cloud in the upper region exhibits a meandering instability, which leads to efficient mixing, whereas the cloud near the vent maintains a concentric structure with an inner dense core surrounded by an outer shear region. Our model is consistent with previous one-dimensional models for steady eruption clouds supported by the laboratory experiments, and it is also applicable to unsteady and transient features of actual eruption clouds.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n爆発的噴火の噴煙のダイナミクスは，噴煙の乱流による周囲の空気の取り込みによって支配されている．著者等は，新しく噴煙の数値的なガスモデルを用いて，３次元の，３次精度，細かいサイズグリッドにより，乱流混合による空気の取り込み効果を検討した．定量的な取り込みはエントレインメント係数（上昇速度に対する流入速度）によって記述される．筆者等のモデルは，室内実験で明らかになっていた取り込みを定量的に再現することに成功し，噴煙の高さは火砕流発生の条件など噴煙のダイナミクスの基礎的な様式を再現した．エントレインメント係数は噴煙の高さと噴煙柱崩壊の臨界条件を筆者等のモデルと，これまでの一次元モデルとの比較によりもとめた．そのけっか，エントレインメント係数は噴煙崩壊時のものが，噴煙の高さによるものよりも若干低いものの，おおむね一定である．この違いは噴煙の流れの高さによる違いを示している．噴煙の上面は蛇行不安定を示し，このことが有効な混合に資する一方，火口近傍では同心円状の構造を維持するためである．},

abstract = {We present the results of laboratory experiments that quantify the physical controls on the thickness of the falling film of liquid around a Taylor bubble, when liquid-gas interfacial tension can be neglected. We find that the dimensionless film thickness lambda' (the ratio of the film thickness to the pipe radius) is a function only of the dimensionless parameter N-f = rho root gD(3)/mu, where rho is the liquid density, g the gravitational acceleration, D the pipe diameter and mu the dynamic viscosity of the liquid. For N-f less than or similar to 10, the dimensionless film thickness is independent of N-f with value lambda' approximate to 0.33; in the interval 10 less than or similar to N-f less than or similar to 10(4), lambda' decreases with increasing N-f; for N-f greater than or similar to 10(4) film thickness is, again, independent of N-f with value lambda' approximate to 0.08. We synthesize existing models for films falling down a plane surface and around a Taylor bubble, and develop a theoretical model for film thickness that encompasses the viscous, inertial and turbulent regimes. Based on our data, we also propose a single empirical correlation for lambda' (N-f), which is valid in the range 10 (1) {\textless} N-f {\textless} 10(5). Finally, we consider the thickness of the falling film when interfacial tension cannot be neglected, and find that film thickness decreases as interfacial tension becomes more important.},

abstract = {We used a novel system of three continuous wave Doppler radars to successfully record the directivity of i) Strombolian explosions from the active lava lake of Erebus volcano, Antarctica, ii) eruptions at Stromboli volcano, Italy, and iii) a man-made explosion in a quarry. Erebus volcano contains a convecting phonolite lava lake, presumably connected to a magma chamber at depth. It is one of the few open vent volcanoes that allow a direct observation of source processes during explosions. Its lava lake is the source of frequent violent Strombolian explosions, caused by large gas bubbles bursting at the lake surface. The exact mechanism of these bubble bursts is unclear, as is the mechanism of the creation of the infrasound signal accompanying the explosions. We use the Doppler radar data to calculate the directivity of Strombolian eruptions at Erebus. This allows us to derive information about the expected type of infrasound source pattern (i.e. the role of a dipole in addition to the monopole signature) and the physical structure of the volcano. We recorded 10 large explosions simultaneously with three radars, enabling us to calculate time series of 3D directivity vectors (i.e. effectively 4D), which describe the direction of preferred expansion of the gas bubble during an explosion. Such directivity information allows a comparison to dipole infrasound radiation patterns recorded during similar explosions only a few weeks later. Video observations of explosions support our interpretation of the measurements. We conclude that at Erebus, the directivity of explosions is mainly controlled by random processes. Since the geometry of the uppermost conduit is assumed to have a large effect on the directivity of explosions, the results suggest a largely symmetrical uppermost conduit with a vertical axis of symmetry. For infrasound recordings, a significant dipole signature can be expected in addition to the predominant monopole signature. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The wave-field of volcano-induced seismic signals at Stromboli volcano (Italy) was observed using a network of four broadband seismometers. In addition to the standard spectral analysis of the recorded signals, new spectral techniques such as wavelet transform and wavelet coherence analysis were also used in order to discriminate between signals related to volcanic tremor and volcanic explosions. The common features of these two types of signals are characterised by the maximum of the power spectral density values located in the frequency band {\textgreater} 2.0 Hz, and the main orientation of the principal axes of the particle motion ellipsoids in the frequency bands analysed. The seismic signals of the volcanic explosions at Stromboli cover the total frequency band, whereas the spectral content of the volcanic tremor is restricted to narrow frequency bands ranging from 0.3-5.0 Hz. In order to localize both types of signals, a modified inversion technique was used. The result of this beam-forming on diffraction hyperboloids of both types of signals reveal a surprisingly shallow source location ranging from 0.2 kin-0.7 km above sea level, suggesting that the sources of the volcanic explosions, as well as of the volcanic tremor, are restricted to the uppermost parts of the volcano. This is in agreement with several nonseismological observations of this volcano. The combination of spectral analysis of volcanic tremor and volcanic explosions with the analysis of ground displacement implies a mechanism which can be described by an ascending bubble of volcanic- gas in a nearly closed volcanic system, and finally the forced ejection of the material through a narrow channel at the top of the magma column},

abstract = {The interpretation of geophysical measurements at active volcanoes is vital for hazard assessment and for understanding fundamental processes such as magma degassing. For Strombolian activity, interpretations are currently underpinned by first-order fluid dynamic models which give relatively straightforward relationships between geophysical signals and gas and magma flow. However, recent petrological and high-speed video evidence has indicated the importance of rheological stratification within the conduit and, here, we show that under these conditions, the straightforward relationships break down. Using laboratory analogue experiments to represent a rheologically-stratified conduit we characterise the distinct variations in the shear stress exerted on the upper sections of the flow tube and in the gas pressures measured above the liquid surface, during different degassing flow configurations. These signals, generated by varying styles of gas ascent, expansion and burst, can reflect field infrasonic measurements and ground motion proximal to a vent. The shear stress signals exhibit timescales and trends in qualitative agreement with the near-vent inflation–deflation cycles identified at Stromboli. Therefore, shear stress along the uppermost conduit may represent a plausible source of near-vent tilt, and conduit shear contributions should be considered in the interpretation of ground deformation, which is usually attributed to pressure sources only. The same range of flow processes can produce different experimental infrasonic waveforms, even for similar masses of gas escape. The experimental data resembled infrasonic waveforms acquired from different vents at Stromboli associated with different eruptive styles. Accurate interpretation of near-vent ground deformation, infrasonic signal and eruptive style therefore requires detailed understanding of: a) spatiotemporal magma rheology in the shallow conduit, and b) shallow conduit geometry, as well as bubble overpressure and volume.},

abstract = {The dynamics of separated two-phase flow of basaltic magmas in cylindrical conduits has been explored combining large-scale experiments and theoretical studies. Experiments consisted of the continuous injection of air into water or glucose syrup in a 0.24 m diameter, 6.5 m long bubble column. The model calculates vesicularity and pressure gradient for a range of gas superficial velocities (volume flow rates/pipe area, 10{\&}{\#}8722;2{\&}{\#}8211;102 m/s), conduit diameters (100{\&}{\#}8211;2 m), and magma viscosities (3{\&}{\#}8211;300 Pa s). The model is calibrated with the experimental results to extrapolate key flow parameters such as Co (distribution parameter) and Froude number, which control the maximum vesicularity of the magma in the column, and the gas rise speed of gas slugs. It predicts that magma vesicularity increases with increasing gas volume flow rate and decreases with increasing conduit diameter, until a threshold value (45 vol.{\%}), which characterizes churn and annular flow regimes. Transition to annular flow regimes is expected to occur at minimum gas volume flow rates of 103{\&}{\#}8211;104 m3/s. The vertical pressure gradient decreases with increasing gas flow rates and is controlled by magma vesicularity (in bubbly flows) or the length and spacing of gas slugs. This study also shows that until conditions for separated flow are met, increases in magma viscosity favor stability of slug flow over bubbly flow but suggests coexistence between gas slugs and small bubbles, which contribute to a small fraction of the total gas outflux. Gas flow promotes effective convection of the liquid, favoring magma homogeneity and stable conditions.},

abstract = {Mass Flow Rate is one of the most crucial eruption source parameter used to define magnitude of eruption and to quantify the ash dispersal in the atmosphere. However, this parameter is in general difficult to be derived and no valid technique has been developed yet to measure it in real time with sufficient accuracy. Linear acoustics has been applied to infrasonic pressure waves generated by explosive eruptions to indirectly estimate the gas mass erupted and then the mass flow rate. Here, we test on Stromboli volcano (Italy) the performance of such methodology by comparing the acoustic derived results with independent gas mass estimates obtained with UV cameras, and constraining the acoustic source by thermal imagery. We show that different acoustic methods give comparable total gas masses in the 2 to 1425??kg range, which are fully consistent with the gas masses derived by UV cameras and previous direct SO2 measurements. We show that total erupted gas mass, estimated by infrasound is not simply a function of the initial pressure, but rather the full infrasonic waveform should be considered. Thermal imagery provides evidence that infrasound is generated during the entire gas thrust phase. We provide examples to show how total gas masses derived by infrasonic signals can be affected by large uncertainties if duration of the signal is neglected. Only when duration of infrasound is included, the best correlation (0.8) with UV cameras and the 1:1 direct linear proportionality is obtained. Our results open new perspective for remotely derived gas mass and mass flow rates from acoustic signals.},

Dominica has been recognized as hosting one of the major ignimbritic eruptions of the last 200 ky in the Lesser Antilles arc, called the Roseau Tuff. But more recent works have evidenced several pumiceous events instead of a single large one. Here we propose a revised chronostratigraphy of the explosive activity that occurred in the last tens of thousands years based on three field trips, new 14C ages, detailed lithological and geochemical investigations, in particular a precise characterization of trace element glass chemistry. This eruptive history reconstruction is mainly based on outcrops along the coast and in the valley, since the luxury vegetation in the center of the island mostly precludes sections close to the central volcanic centers. We thus confirm that the Roseau event has been overestimated and that we may recognize five main ignimbritic events: Grande Savane, Layou ({\~{}} 51 ka), Grand Bay, Roseau ({\~{}} 33 ka), Grand Fond ({\~{}} 24 ka). We discuss the possible volcanic center at their origin, in addition to correlations with some Plinian events of lower magnitude that were identified in the Roseau valley and in the southern part of Dominica. This study may help to better constrain the eruptive history of the most active volcanic island of the Lesser Antilles arc, which has important implications on hazard mitigation.},

Similar monotonic infrasound had been previously reported at Villarrica (e.g., Ripepe et al. [2010]). Using joint infrasound and visual observations from a suspended camera we demonstrate that the likely source of infrasound is Helmholtz resonance produced from a cavity with volume 105 m3 that separates the active convecting lava lake from an overhanging spatter roof. Spatter roof dimension (65 m diameter) and vent diameter (10 m) in the roof are constrained from video observations. Assuming a cylindrical cavity we infer a cavity height of 31 m that is corroborated by video records of spatter drips. The drips take as long as 2.2 s to fall from the roof into the lake, corresponding to a height of more than 24 m, which is in good agreement with the observed resonance frequency.},

abstract = {The ascent of magma during the A.D. 79 eruption of Vesuvius was studied by a steady-state, one-dimensional, and nonequilibrium two-phase flow model. The gas exsolution process was modeled by assuming a chemical equilibrium between the exsolved and dissolved gas, whereas the magma density and viscosity were modeled by accounting for the crystal content in magma. The exsolution, density, and viscosity models consider the effect of different compositions of the white and gray magmas. By specifying the conduit geometry and magma composition, and employing the model to search for the maximum discharge rate of magma which is consistent with the specified geometry and magma composition, the model was then used to establish the two-phase flow parameters along the conduit. It was found that for all considered conditions the magma pressure in the conduit decreases below the lithostatic pressure near the magma fragmentation level, and that in the deep regions of the conduit the white magma pressure is larger and the gray magma pressure is lower than the lithostatic one. The exsolution and fragmentation levels were found to be deeper for the white than for the gray magma, and the changing composition during the eruption causes an increase of the exit pressure and decrease of the exit gas volumetric fraction. The model also predicted a minimum conduit diameter which is consistent with the white and gray magma compositions and mass flow-rates. The predictions of the model were shown to be consistent with column collapses during the gray eruption phase, large presence of carbonate lithics in the gray pumice fall deposit, and magma-water interaction during a late stage of the eruption. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Video surveillance systems are consolidated techniques for monitoring eruptive phenomena in volcanic areas. Along with these systems, which use standard video cameras, people working in this field sometimes make use of infrared cameras providing useful information about the thermal evolution of eruptions. Real-time analysis of the acquired frames is required, along with image storing, to analyze and classify the activity of volcanoes. Human effort and large storing capabilities are hence required to perform monitoring tasks. In this paper we present a new strategy aimed at improving the performance of video surveillance systems in terms of human-independent image processing and storing optimization. The proposed methodology is based on real-time thermo-graphic analysis of the area considered. The analysis is performed by processing images acquired with an IR camera and extracting information about meaningful volcanic events. Two software tools were developed. The first provides information about the activity being monitored and automatically adapts the image storing rate. The second tool automatically produces useful information about the eruptive activity encompassed by a selected frame sequence. The software developed includes a suitable user interface allowing for convenient management of the acquired images and easy access to information about the volcanic activity monitored. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We identify and quantify controls on the timescales and magnitudes of cyclic (periodic) volcanic eruptions using the numerical model DOMEFLOW (de' Michieli Vitturi et al., 2010) which was developed by the authors for magma systems of intermediate composition. DOMEFLOW treats the magma mixture as a liquid continuum with dispersed gas bubbles and crystals in thermodynamic equilibrium with the melt and assumes a modified Poiseuille form of the viscous term for fully developed laminar flow in a conduit of cylindrical cross-section. During ascent, magma pressure decreases and water vapor exsolves and partially degasses from the melt as the melt simultaneously crystallizes, causing changes in mixture density and viscosity. Two mechanisms previously proposed to cause periodic eruption behavior have been implemented in the model and their corresponding timescales explored. The first applies a stick-slip model in which motion of a shallow solid plug is resisted by static/dynamic friction, as described in Iverson et al. (2006). For a constant magma supply rate at depth, this mechanism yields cyclic extrusion with timescales of seconds to tens of seconds with values generally depending on assumed friction coefficients. The second mechanism does not consider friction but treats the plug as a high-viscosity Newtonian fluid. During viscous resistance, pressure beneath the degassed plug can increase sufficiently to overcome dome overburden, plug weight, and viscous forces, and ultimately drive the plug from the conduit. In this second model cycle periods are on the order of hours, and decrease with increasing magma supply rate until a threshold is reached, at which point periodicity disappears and extrusion rate becomes steady (vanishingly short periods). Magma volatile content for fixed chamber pressure has little effect on cycle timescales, but increasing volatile content increases mass flow rate and cycle magnitude as defined by the difference between maximum and minimum extrusion rates. Increasing mass flow rate also increases the magnitude of predicted deformation cycles. Both models have been applied to dome-building eruptions using conditions appropriate for the Soufri??re Hills volcano, Montserrat. Results suggest that the modeled stick-slip mechanism cannot explain the cycles of extrusion and explosion well-documented at Montserrat (timescales of hours). However, a subset of the simulations for the viscous plug model are consistent with the Montserrat data and therefore demonstrate the feasibility of this second formulation. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The frequency of exposure of local populations to the ash led to substantial concerns about possible respiratory health hazards, resulting in many epidemiological and toxicological studies being carried out in the 1980s. However, very few mineralogical data were available for determination of whether the ash was sufficiently fine to present a respiratory hazard. In this study, we review the existing studies and carry out mineralogical, geochemical and toxicological analyses to address whether the ash from Sakurajima has the potential to cause respiratory health problems. The results show that the amount of respirable ({\textless}4 {\$}\mu{\$}m) material produced by the volcano is highly variable in different eruptions (1.1--18.8 vol.{\{}{\%}{\}}). The finest samples derive from historical, plinian eruptions but considerable amounts of respirable material were also produced from the most recent vulcanian eruptive phase (since 1955). The amount of cristobalite, a crystalline silica polymorph which has the potential to cause chronic respiratory diseases, is {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}3--5 wt.{\{}{\%}{\}} in the bulk ash. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope imaging showed no fibrous particles similar to asbestos particles. Surface reactivity tests showed that the ash did not produce significant amounts of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (0.09--1.35 {\$}\mu{\$}mol m−2 at 30 min.) in comparison to other volcanic ash types. A basic toxicology assay to assess the ability of ash to rupture the membrane of red blood cells showed low propensity for haemolysis. The findings suggest that the potential health hazard of the ash is low, but exposure and respiratory conditions should still be monitored given the high frequency and durations of exposure.},

abstract = {Detailed study of rates and extent of ground deformation during and following the September 1984 eruption of the Krafla volcano, northeast Iceland, revealed the existence of several reservoirs that feed magma towards the volcano. A shallow magma reservoir - the Krafla magma reservoir - appears to be centered 2.6 km below the central part of the Krafla caldera. Three additional magma reservoirs, each displaying its own characteristic flow behavior, feed magma into the shallow reservoir. Reservoir I supplied very rapid flow during and immediately after the eruption. Reservoir II was the dominant supplier of magma 3 weeks to 4 months after the beginning of the 2 week long eruption. Reservoir III had dominated the supply of magma to the shallow reservoir for two years prior to the eruption. Reservoir I lies at a depth of less than 10 km and may be regarded as a smaller downward continuation of the shallow Krafla reservoir. Reservoir II appears to be deeper than 20 km and to have a volume roughly 5 times that of the shallow reservoir. Reservoir III lies at an indetermined depth, and its volume is immense. The Krafla volcano started to deflate at about 20h20 on September 4, 1984, and the eruption commenced at 23h49 and continued until September 18. The lava covered a 24-km2 area, and its volume can be roughly estimated as 108 m3. About 20 million m3 of magma were emplaced as a dike, one meter thick and 8.5 km long, below the eruptive fissure. The deflation of the volcano as measured by the volume of the subsidence bowl, shows that 60-80 million m3 of magma escaped from the shallow magma reservoir immediately before and during the eruption. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {We report on the evaluation of in situ measurements of eruption velocities and relative mass flux, collected by Doppler radar, as well as acoustic and infrared data, that were recorded at Stromboli volcano. Doppler radar observations were made alongside thermal, acoustic and seismic measurements, to (1) further investigate the complex waveforms of the SW crater by combining infrasonic, infrared and Doppler radar measurements, (2) establish a relationship between infrared, acoustic and Doppler radar measurements and (3) verify that all instruments observe the same behavior in terms of relative mass eruption rate. We also explore the relationship between kinetic and acoustic energy released during an eruption. Comparing the different methods to each other we are able to show that the mass erupted can be estimated either from the total reflected Doppler radar energy or from infrared observations. However, neither thermal nor reflected energy can provide a value in terms of absolute mass in kg. The erupted masses of different eruptions can only be evaluated relative to each other. Using the combined three data sets we especially focus on the eruption dynamics of the SW crater of Stromboli, namely its fluctuations in eruption strength. These pulses in one eruptive event, so called 'pulsations' dominate more than 40{\%} of the eruptions of SW crater. Previous models that explain pulsations to be generated by multiple consecutively exploding bubbles are supported by our combined analysis of infrasound, thermal data, particle velocities, and the reflected energy. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Experimental studies are reported on the flooding phenomenon and on the closely associated churn flow regime. Flooding experiments were carried out with air-water flow in a 32 mm dia vertical pipe with various forms of liquid outlet, namely a porous wall, a tapered outlet and a square-edged outlet. For the first time, downflow (penetration) measurements were made with the porous wall outlet and showed significant differences between penetration rates beyond flooding and the flooding rate. This contrasts with other types of injectors, where the mechanisms of flooding are somewhat different. Measurement of pressure drop and holdup in the churn flow regime were made both with and without a co-existing falling film below the liquid injector. These showed that the falling-film and churn flow regions were essentially decoupled. Analysis of the data for churn flow showed that the minimum pressure gradient does not, for this data, correspond to the condition of zero wall shear stress as had been suggested by some earlier analytical studies. Interfacial shear stresses in churn flow were compared with those used in current reactor safety codes (TRAC and RELAP) and it was found that, for the churn flow region, the relationships used in the RELAP code were more appropriate. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

We discuss similarities and differences between hybrid earthquakes and long-period events, and their role in explosions and rockfall events. These events occur usually in swarms, and occasionally merge into tremor, an observation that can shed further light on the generation and composition of harmonic tremor. We use a 2D finite difference method to model major features of low-frequency seismic signatures and compare them with the observations. A depth-dependent velocity model for a fluid-filled conduit is introduced which accounts for the varying gas-content in the magma, and the impact on the seismic signals is discussed. We carefully analyse episodes of tremor that show shifting spectral lines and model those in terms of changes in the gas content of the magma as well as in terms of a time-dependent triggering mechanism of low-frequency resonances. In this way we explain the simultaneous occurrence of low-frequency events and tremor with a spectral content comprising integer harmonics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A common sequence of phenomena associated with volcanic explosions is extracted based on seismic and ground deformation observations at 3 active volcanoes in Japan and Indonesia. Macroscopic inflation-related ground deformations are detected prior to individual explosions, while deflations are observed during eruptions. Precursory inflation occurs 5 min to several hours before eruption at the Sakurajima volcano, but just 1-2 min at Suwanosejima and 3-30 min at the Semeru volcano. The sequence commences with minor contraction, which is detected by extensometers 1.5 min before eruption at Sakurajima, as a dilatant first motion of the explosion earthquakes 0.2-0.3 s before surface explosions at Suwanosejima, and as downward tilt 4-5 s prior to eruption at the Semeru volcano. The sequence is detected for explosive eruptions with {\textgreater} 0.1 $\mu$rad tilt change at Sakurajima, 90{\%} at Suwanosejima and 75{\%} at Semeru volcanoes. It is inferred that the minor contraction is caused by a volume and pressure decrease due to the release of gas from a pocket at the top of the conduit as the gas pressure exceeds the strength of the confining plug. The subsequent violent expansion may be triggered by sudden outgassing of the water-saturated magma induced by the decrease in confining pressure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An equation is presented for the calculation of the shear viscosity of hydrous (0-12.5 wt{\%} H (sub 2) O leucogranitic melts from 10 (super 2) to 10 (super 13) Pa.s. The equation is a multiple nonlinear least-squares regression of a data set of 111 viscosity determinations in the literature. It is based on the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) form and thus accounts for the very important non-Arrhenian temperature dependence of the viscosity. This is possible because of the inclusion of data obtained recently in the high-viscosity region. The equation includes a logarithmic dependence of the three adjustable parameters of the VFT equation on the H (sub 2) O content of the melt. The root-mean-standard deviation for the 111 data points included is 0.46 log (sub 10) units. In comparison with earlier methods based on the Arrhenian approximation of the temperature dependence of viscosity, the present method provides significant improvement in the accurate prediction of viscosity. We recommend its use in all petrologic calculations involving hydrous, metaluminous, leucogranitic melts. It is an especially powerful method for calculating the high viscosities thought to be relevant to erupting silicic volcanic systems and magmatic hydrothermal granitic and pegmatitic systems at the brittle-ductile transition.},

abstract = {At high confining pressure the coefficient of friction, µ, for granite depends on the relative displacement of the surfaces. For ground surfaces, µ reaches a maximum after about 0.1 cm and then decreases to nearly a constant value after 0.5 cm of sliding has occurred. Features on the surfaces after sliding suggest that the maximum is reached when intimate contact is first established. Also, this maximum value is the same as the initial µ for perfectly mated rough surfaces. The decrease in µ from the maximum is probably caused by rolling on wear particles between the surfaces, µ decreases with an increase in normal stress, owing to a finite shear strength at zero pressure of interlocking irregularities on the surfaces. Water reduces the frictional shear strength of granite by about 400 bars, independent of the normal stress across the sliding surfaces. Brittle fracture of surface asperities may be the controlling mechanism during the frictional sliding of brittle materials such as granite. Up to the highest pressures investigated, sliding movement between the surfaces occurred with violent stick-slip. Stick-slip along a pre-existing fault may be a source of crustal earthquakes. The {\&}{\#}8216;brittle-ductile{\&}{\#}8217; transition pressure in silicate rocks may simply be the pressure at which the frictional shear strength is equal to the fracture shear strength. In the Coulomb theory it is assumed that the strength of a rock is determined by µ and the cohesive strength. The theory does not hold for westerly granite. According to the effective stress theory, the stress required for one block of rock to slide on another in the presence of pore fluid of pressure p is given by $\tau$ = µ$\sigma${\_}n -p). The theory holds for granite if µ is the coefficient of friction for sliding on water-saturated surfaces and if allowances are made for the fact that µ may be a function of the effective stress across the surfaces.},

abstract = {Simple shear deformation experiments on three-phase, hydrous, haplogranitic magmas, composed of quartz crystals (24-65 vol.{\%}), CO2-rich gas bubbles (9-12 vol.{\%}) and melt in different proportions, were performed with a Paterson-type rock deformation apparatus. Strain rates from 5 10-6 s-1 to 4 10-3 s-1 were applied at temperatures between 723 and 1023 K and at pressure of 200 MPa. The results show that the three-phase suspension rheology is strongly strain rate dependent (non-Newtonian behavior). Two non-Newtonian regimes were observed: shear thinning (viscosity decreases with increasing strain rate) and shear thickening (viscosity increases with increasing strain rate). Shear thinning occurs in crystal-rich magmas (55-65 vol.{\%} crystals; 9-10 vol.{\%} bubbles) as a result of crystal size reduction and shear zoning. Shear thickening prevails in dilute suspensions (24 vol.{\%} crystals; 12 vol.{\%} bubbles), where bubble coalescence and outgassing dominate. At intermediate crystallinity (44 vol.{\%} crystals; 12 vol.{\%} bubbles) both shear thickening and thinning occur. Based on the microstructural observations using synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy, bubbles can develop two different shapes: oblate at low temperature ({\textless}873 K) and prolate at high temperature ({\textgreater}873 K). These differences in shape are caused by different conditions of flow: unsteady flow, where the relaxation time of the bubbles is much longer than the timescale of deformation (oblate shapes); steady flow, where bubbles are in their equilibrium deformation state (prolate shapes). Three-phase magmas are characterized by a rheological behavior that is substantially different with respect to suspensions containing only crystals or only gas bubbles. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Due to the fluid rheological properties, the bubble shape is elongated, and, when bursting at the free surface, acts as a resonator. For a given fluid concentration, at constant flow rate, repetitive bubble bursting occurs at the surface. We report a modulation pattern of the acoustic waveform through time. Moreover, we point out the existence of a precursor acoustic signal, recorded on the microphone array, previous to each bursting. The time delay between this precursor and the bursting signal is well correlated with the bursting signal frequency content. Their joint modulation through time is driven by the fluid rheology, which strongly depends on the presence of small satellite bubbles trapped in the fluid due to the yield stress.},

(2) whole-rock SiO2 content, a crude but widely reported indicator of magma viscosity, shows no systematic relationship to the timing and character of explosions; 3.

The cycles, over hours to days, initiated when degassed stiff magma retarded flow in the upper conduit. Conduit pressure built with gas exsolution, causing shallow seismicity and edifice inflation. Magma and gas were then expelled and the edifice deflated. The repeat time-scale is controlled by magma ascent rates, degassing, and microlite crystallization kinetics.

abstract = {The Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF), which last erupted ca. 550 years ago, is a late Quaternary monogenetic basaltic volcanic field (ca. 500 km2) in the northern North Island of New Zealand. Prior to this study only 12 out of the 53 identified eruptive centres of the AVF had been reliably dated. Careful sample preparation and 40Ar/39Ar analysis has increased the number of well-dated centres in the AVF to 35. The high precision of the results is attributed to selection of fresh, non-vesicular, non-glassy samples from lava flow interiors. Sample selection was coupled with separation techniques that targeted only the groundmass of samples with {\textless} 5{\%} glass and with groundmass feldspars {\textgreater} 10 $\mu$m wide, coupled with ten-increment furnace step-heating of large quantities (up to 200 mg) of material. The overall AVF age data indicate an onset at 193.2 ± 2.8 ka, an apparent six-eruption flare-up from 30 to 34 ka, and a ≤ 10 kyr hiatus between the latest and second-to-latest eruptions. Such non-uniformity shows that averaging the number of eruptions over the life-span of the AVF to yield a mean eruption rate is overly simplistic. Together with large variations in eruption volumes, and the large sizes and unusual chemistry within the latest eruptions (Rangitoto 1 and Rangitoto 2), our results illuminate a complex episodic eruption history. In particular, the rate of volcanism in AVF has increased since 60 ka, suggesting that the field is still in its infancy. Multiple centres with unusual paleomagnetic inclination and declination orientations are confirmed to fit into a number of geomagnetic excursions, with five identified in the Mono Lake, two within the Laschamp, one within the post-Blake or Blake, and two possibly within the Hilina Pali.},

abstract = {Volcanic activity at Mount Erebus is dominated by eruptive activity within a phonolitic summit lava lake. Common eruption styles range from passive degassing to Strombolian explosions, which typically occur several times daily, and occasionally in swarms of up to 900 per day. Shallow explosions, although generally the result of steady exsolution of volatiles from depth, can be triggered by surficial input of H2O through mass wasting of rock, snow and ice from the crater walls. Broadband observations of Strombolian explosions document very-long-period (VLP) signals with strong spectral peaks near 20, 12 and 7 s, which are polarized in the vertical/radial plane. These signals precede lava lake surface explosions by {\~{}} 1.5 s, are highly repeatable, and persist for up to 200 s. First motions indicate a deflationary source, with any precursory inflation being below the {\~{}} 30 s passband of our instruments. Particle motions suggest a VLP source residing up to 800 m below the lava lake surface; however, this depth could be exaggerated by near-field radial tilt. Seismic and acoustic signals associated with lava lake explosions commonly show evidence for multiple bubble bursts in corresponding complexity features resulting from varying time delays and relative sizes of superimposed bursts. A systematic decrease in seismic/acoustic ratio for smaller surface explosions suggests that either the seismic energy from the smallest, shallowest bubble bursts experiences much greater seismic attenuation than energy arising from larger events which may involve a deeper, less attenuative portion of the magma column, and/or that the shallowest layer is seismically isolated from deeper parts of a stratified magma column, which are not excited by the smallest explosions due to sharp impedance contrasts across distinct layers. Tremor at Erebus is uncommon, with only a few isolated instances identified in five years of monitoring. Some tremor events are nearly monochromatic, and some exhibit numerous gliding harmonic spectral lines. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In April 2007, Piton de la Fournaise volcano experienced a caldera collapse during its largest historical eruption. We present here a structural analysis both of the caldera and the surrounding area, and precise GPS data recorded with a dense GPS network specifically dedicated to the analysis of deformation related to the summit collapse structures. Despite a collapse of more than 300??m in the central zone, the geometry of the new caldera is similar in map view to that of the pre-existing collapsed structure, which was formed from the coalescence of several pit craters. The caldera shows an asymmetric inner geometry with sub-vertical walls in the NW quadrant and steep scarps composed of inward tilted blocks in the southern half. The presence of preserved polished surfaces on the lower part of the sub-vertical scarp indicates that it corresponds to the caldera north-western ring fault. The April 2007 caldera collapse led to the development and the reactivation of concentric fractures on the caldera rim, mostly along the southern limit of the caldera. GPS data show that fractures result from radial extensional stresses that are restricted within the first tens of meters of the caldera edge. GPS data also reveal that the caldera collapse was coeval with a centripetal deflation, whose magnitude is largest along the southern half of the caldera. The displacements recorded by GPS result from both a general deflation, due to magma withdrawal from Piton de la Fournaise's summit magma chamber, and additional local effects related to the caldera collapse. Comparison of the caldera collapses at Piton de la Fournaise, Miyakejima and Fernandina reveals striking similarities, with cyclic seismic signals accompanying small-scale deflation-inflation cycles. This strongly suggests a common mode of collapse. Hence, we propose a unifying model of caldera collapse in basaltic setting, in which the inward deflation due to magma withdrawal from the magma chamber prevents the collapse of the caldera roof until the gravitational stress acting on the rock column above the magma chamber exceeds the shear strength along pre-existing ring faults. The downward displacement stops when the pressure increase into the magma chamber is able to again sustain the rock column. The succession of (1) inward deflation that prevents the collapse, (2) collapse due to gravitational stress and (3) stopping of the downward motion is repeated many times. The frequency of the cycles is influenced by the rate of magma withdrawal and by the amount of intrusion of magma along the ring faults. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In 1997 Soufriere Hills Volcano on Montserrat produced 88 Vulcanian explosions: 13 between 4 and 12 August and 75 between 22 September and 21 October. Each episode was preceded by a large dome collapse that decompressed the conduit and led to the conditions for explosive fragmentation. The explosions, which occurred at intervals of 2.5 to 63 hours, with a mean of 10 hours, were transient events, with an initial high-intensity phase lasting a few tens of seconds and a lower-intensity, waning phase lasting 1 to 3 hours. In all but one explosion, fountain collapse during the first 10-20 seconds generated pyroclastic surges that swept out to 1-2 km before lofting, as well as high-concentration pumiceous pyroclastic flows that travelled up to 6 km down all major drainages around the dome. Buoyant plumes ascended 3-15 km into the atmosphere, where they spread out as umbrella clouds. Most umbrella clouds were blown to the north or NW by high-level (8-18 km) winds, whereas the lower, waning plumes were dispersed to the west or NW by low-level ({\textless}5 km) winds. Exit velocities measured from videos ranged from 40 to 140 ms-1 and ballistic blocks were thrown as far as 1.7 km from the dome. Each explosion discharged on average 3 x 105m3 of magma, about one-third forming fallout and two-thirds forming pyroclastic flows and surges, and emptied the conduit to a depth of 0.5-2 km or more. Two overlapping components were distinguished in the explosion seismic signals: a low-frequency (c. 1 Hz) one due to the explosion itself, and a high-frequency ({\textgreater}2 Hz) one due to fountain collapse, ballistic impact and pyroclastic flow. In many explosions a delay between the explosion onset and start of the pyroclastic flow signal (typically 10-20 seconds) recorded the time necessary for ballistics and the collapsing fountain to hit the ground. The explosions in August were accompanied by cyclic patterns of seismicity and edifice deformation due to repeated pressurization of the upper conduit. The angular, tabular forms of many fallout pumices show that they preserve vesicularities and shapes acquired upon fragmentation, and suggest that the explosions were driven by brittle fragmentation of overpressured magmatic foam with at least 55 vol{\%} bubbles present in the upper conduit prior to each event.},

For higher overpressure, the amplitude inside the conduit is smaller than the linear prediction, whereas the amplitude measured outside is larger. The frequency content remains harmonic, even at high initial overpressure.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate roller coaster facilitation of calyceal renal calculi passage using a functional pyelocalyceal renal model. METHODS A previously described adult ureteroscopy and renoscopy simulator (Ideal Anatomic) was modified and remolded to function as a patient surrogate. Three renal calculi of different sizes from the patient who provided the original computed tomographic urograph on which the simulator was based were used. The renal calculi were suspended in urine in the model and taken for 20 rides on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. The roller coaster rides were analyzed using variables of renal calculi volume, calyceal location, model position on the roller coaster, and renal calculi passage. RESULTS Sixty renal calculi rides were analyzed. Independent of renal calculi volume and calyceal location, front seating on the roller coaster resulted in a passage rate of 4 of 24. Independent of renal calculi volume and calyceal location, rear seating on the roller coaster resulted in a passage rate of 23 of 36. Independent of renal calculi volume in rear seating, calyceal location differed in passage rates, with an upper calyceal calculi passage rate of 100{\%}; a middle calyceal passage rate of 55.6{\%}; and a lower calyceal passage rate of 40.0{\%}. CONCLUSION The functional pyelocalyceal renal model serves as a functional patient surrogate to evaluate activities that facilitate calyceal renal calculi passage. The rear seating position on the roller coaster led to the most renal calculi passages.},

abstract = {The segmentation and differentiation of subducting slabs have considerable effects on mantle convection and tectonics. The Hellenic subduction zone is a complex convergent margin with strong curvature and fast slab rollback. The upper mantle seismic anisotropy in the region is studied focusing at its western and eastern edges in order to explore the effects of possible slab segmentation on mantle flow and fabrics. Complementary to new SKS shear-wave splitting measurements in regions not adequately sampled so far, the source-side splitting technique is applied to constrain the depth of anisotropy and to densify measurements. In the western Hellenic arc, a trench-normal subslab anisotropy is observed near the trench. In the forearc domain, source-side and SKS measurements reveal a trench-parallel pattern. This indicates subslab trench-parallel mantle flow, associated with return flow due to the fast slab rollback. The passage from continental to oceanic subduction in the western Hellenic zone is illustrated by a forearc transitional anisotropy pattern. This indicates subslab mantle flow parallel to a NE–SW smooth ramp that possibly connects the two subducted slabs. A young tear fault initiated at the Kefalonia Transform Fault is likely not entirely developed, as this trench-parallel anisotropy pattern is observed along the entire western Hellenic subduction system, even following this horizontal offset between the two slabs. At the eastern side of the Hellenic subduction zone, subslab source-side anisotropy measurements show a general trench-normal pattern. These are associated with mantle flow through a possible ongoing tearing of the oceanic lithosphere in the area. Although the exact geometry of this slab tear is relatively unknown, SKS trench-parallel measurements imply that the tear has not reached the surface yet. Further exploration of the Hellenic subduction system is necessary; denser seismic networks should be deployed at both its edges in order to achieve a more definite image of the structure and geodynamics of this area.},

abstract = {At high flow rates during polymer melt extrusion, pressure oscillations can be observed. The phenomenon is usually referred to as spurt, due to the irregular—in bursts—emergence of the melt out of the die. Spurt, or equivalently, the associated pressure oscillations have been modelled successfully through the mechanism of relaxation-oscillations by Molenaar and Koopmans. The presence of a non-monotone flow curve is at the heart of this modelling. In this paper the curve is deduced from conservation laws combined with a die wall boundary condition and specific constitutive equations. Subsequently, three `model curves' are compared. Model A, a Newtonian fluid with a `switch function' defining an alternating stick-slip boundary condition. Model B is a non-monotone constitutive equation i.e. a Johnson-Segalman-Oldroyd (JSO) fluid with a no-slip condition. Model C consists of two Newtonian fluids in concentric die regions and a no-slip condition. It is shown that Models A and C are able to describe spurt that is in qualitative agreement with experiments reported in literature. Model B, however, does not lead to spurt, in spite of the non-monotone nature of the steady stress–strain rate curve! These results tend to show that there are many options to describe experimental flow curves with equations based on geometrical, operational and polymer property parameters. Accordingly, from a mathematical point of view, and in view of the equivalence in results between model A and C, it can be concluded that the existing controversy between slip or no-slip (i.e. constitutive) supporters is not a fundamental one.},

abstract = {The viscosity of silicic melts depends strongly on their water content. As bubbles grow in a supersaturated melt, water evaporates from the bubble-melt interface. A diffusive profile develops and leads to steep viscosity gradients across the melt shell. Here we investigate the effects of radial viscosity profiles on the dynamics of bubble growth. We find that the effective melt viscosity resisting gas overpressure in the bubbles is close to the viscosity at the dehydrated rind, and may be higher than that of the surrounding melt by more than an order of magnitude. As a result, bubbles may retain pressures that are higher than ambient pressure for longer times, magma degassing is delayed to shallower depth, and fragmentation of magma due to gas overpressure may occur over a wider range of conditions. Measured water content in eruption products yields information on the average melt viscosity, however additional information about the concentration profiles is needed for estimating the effective viscosity that controlled the evolution of bubble growth in the ejecta. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The prevalence of andesitic and dacitic volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years has led to a new appreciation of processes typical of magmas of intermediate composition. Extensive syn-eruptive crystallization, driven by decompression and volatile exsolution, is one such process. A water-saturated melt that is decompressed isothermally from its liquidus must crystallize in response to the diminishing capacity of the melt to retain volatiles (particularly H2O). Only rapid magma ascent allows such a melt to reach the Earth's surface without crystallizing. Intermediate rates of ascent permit varying amounts of syn-eruptive crystallization, which in turn changes magma rheology and affects continued magma progress toward the surface. Feedback among magma decompression, vesiculation, and crystallization is poorly understood, particularly with regard to the kinetics of crystallization. Here we present two complementary approaches to the study of syn-eruptive, degassing-induced crystallization. The first involves projection of matrix glass compositions onto the well-understood Qz-Ab-Or ternary, which allows relative (quartz-undersaturated melt) or absolute (quartz-saturated melt) determination of magma equilibration (or 'closure') pressure. We show that glass composition (groundmass crystallinity) changes as a function of decompression rate, and that either very slow ascent or rapid ascent followed by arrest and shallow cooling can lead to extensive cotectic precipitation of quartz+feldspar.

abstract = {We present the initial results of a quantitative investigation of the volatile geochemistry of Deception Island, an active volcano situated near the spreading axis of a Quaternary ensialic marginal basin (Bransfield Strait, northern Antarctic Peninsula). Fluorine contents in Deception Island magmas (112-461 ppm) are comparable with lavas from a range of tectonic environments but F-K2O relationships most closely compare with continental flood basalts and lavas from island arcs and some marginal basins. Boron contents are high (4.3-16.3 ppm) and the values overlap with those of arc lavas; they provide strong support for the presence of a mantle source component derived from the slab subducted at the coeval trench (by melting at the slab/wedge interface and/or during slab dehydration). Both F and B acted incompatibly in Deception Island magmas but there is significant variation in incompatible-element ratios such as K/F, K/B, P/F, P/B, which strongly suggests that the magmatic system was open to some or all of these elements during differentation. The variations in these ratios also provide evidence for the presence of at least two stages in the magmatic evolution of the volcano. During pre-caldera times, mafic magma was emplaced into the upper crust where it evolved and may have reacted with the crustal envelope, thus changing the contents of some or all of the elements F, B, K and P and their inter-element ratios. A later, large influx of hot, mafic magma into the chamber may have been responsible for a major eruption that ultimately led to the formation of the caldera. K/F, K/B, etc, ratios in the magma chamber were "reset" and subsequently continued to change, possibly by further crustal interaction during melt evolution in post-caldera times. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The landslide and cataclysmic eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980 triggered a sequence of explosive eruptions over the following five months. The volume of explosive products from each of these eruptions decreased uniformly over this period, and the character for each eruption progressed from a fairly continuous eruption lasting more than eight hours on May 18 to a series of short bursts, some of which were spaced 12 hours apart, on October 16-18. The transition in the character of these eruption sequences can be explained by a difference between the magma supply rate and the magma discharge rate from a shallow reservoir. The magma supply rate (MSR) is the rate with which magma is supplied to the level where disruption due to vesiculation occurs. It is determined by dividing the dense-rock-equivalent volume of eruptive products by the total duration of each eruption sequence. The magma discharge rate (MDR) is the rate with which the disrupted magma is discharged through the vent. It is determined by dividing the volume of erupted products by the duration of each explosive burst. The relative magnitude of these two quantities controls the temporal evolution of an explosive event. When MDR???MSR the explosive phase of the eruption lasts for several hours as a single continuous event. When MDR{\textgreater}MSR, an eruption is characterized by a series of short explosive bursts at intervals of several minutes to several days. The MSR of the eruptions of 1980 decreased with time from 5500 m' s-1 on May 18 to 7 m3 s-2 on October 16-18 and approximately fits an exponential decay. The MDR for the same events remained approximately constant at 2000 m3 s-1. Each explosive event has been followed by an aftershock-like series of earthquakes located beneath the volcano at depth mostly between 7 and 14 km. The seismic energy released during each of these series is proportional to the corresponding volume of erupted magma. Deformation data between June and November, 1980 indicate a subsidence of the volcanic structure which can be modeled by a volume collapse of 0.25 km3 located at 9 km depth. We propose a model in which magma is supplied from depths of 7-14 km through a narrow conduit during each eruption. It erupts to the surface at a uniform rate during each eruption. The deep seismic activity following each eruption is related to a readjustment and volume decrease in the deep feeding system. The decrease of the MSR over time is explained by an increase in the viscosity of a progressively water-depleted magma. The amount of water necessary to explain the observed decrease of the MSR is of the order of 4.6{\%}. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {Combined video, infrasound and seismic observations were conducted at Suwanosejima volcano in August 2005, and the processes producing infrasound radiation at the onset of an eruption were examined based on the results of the observations. Infrasound waveforms were found to exhibit a slow weak pressure increase (preceding phase) 0.7s before the large rapid main compression phase. These pressure changes induced a subtle H2O phase change in steam discharged from the crater, which could not be easily recognized in the normal video images. However, propagation of the pressure waves could be identified by image processing as luminance variations above the crater. These variations coincided with the compression phase of the infrasound wave. The origin time of the preceding phase estimated from the arrival times of an infrasound wave at two different stations and the luminance data was almost identical to the time when, based on the seismic signals, a vertical expansion occurred at a depth of about 0.5km beneath the crater bottom. Considering the eruption processes of Sakurajima volcano, it was concluded that the preceding phase of the infrasound wave was caused by swelling of the ground surface at the crater bottom due to this expansion beneath the crater. In the case of the Suwanosejima eruption, the volumetric change due this ground uplift was estimated to be 30-40m3. The origin time of the subsequent main phase of the infrasound wave coincided with the onset of volcanic material ejection. This suggests that the crater bottom, which acted as a lid to the pressurized magma and gases before the eruption, failed due to the expansion that occurred during the 0.7s period prior to the eruption. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The recording of this simultaneous activity on an array of three broadband, seismo-acoustic instruments provides detailed information of the state of the conduit and vent during this phase of volcanic eruption. Quasi-periodic tremor at Reventador is similar to that observed at other volcanoes and may be used as an indicator of vent aperture.

abstract = {We analyse a microgravity data set acquired along the Etna network and spanning a 5 year long period (1994-1999). The main feature observed is a complete gravity increase (1994-1996)-decrease (1997-1999) cycle mainly affecting the southeastern sector of the volcano and reaching a maximum amplitude of approximately 100 muGal peak-to-peak. The gravity changes are principally due not to elevation changes but rather to the direct gravitational effect of magma accumulation and drainage below the volcanic pile. In particular, a complete mass increase-decrease cycle took place within a 2-4 km bsl deep reservoir that is elongated, oriented NNW-SSE, and lies in the southeastern sector of the volcano. The observed cycle accounts for a volume of magma ranging between 3 and 10 x 10(8) m(3) , which is believed to have passed through the inferred reservoir between 1994 and 1999. Since most of this magma has not been erupted nor accumulated at shallower levels (at the summit Etna stations a compatible gravity increase has not been observed), it could have been recycled by the Etna plumbing system, sinking down to a level deeper than that of the inferred source.},

abstract = {The August 2012 to October 2013 White Island unrest sequence included 5 explosive volcanic eruptions and emplacement of a small dome. These events were linked to an overall increase in SO2 and H2S gas flux and RSAM seismic tremor which began in late 2011. Prior to this unrest, a small swarm of 25 events was observed on 19–21 August 2011 and captured on a temporary seismic array including 14 broadband sensors. Each event comprised coupled pulses having distinct high frequency (HF = 2–5 Hz), long-period (LP = 0.5–1.1 Hz) and very long period (VLP = 0.03–0.125 Hz or 8–30 s) earthquakes. For each coupled event, we compute the source locations, origin times and related uncertainties by application of standard arrival time locations for the HF earthquakes and waveform semblance for the LP and VLP earthquakes. Results suggest that the events are centred beneath the active vent at depths generally {\textless} 1.5 km. The HF and LP earthquakes have shallow depths ({\textless} 1 km), while VLP have slightly deeper source locations (0.8–1.5 km). Emergent onsets for LP and VLP sources make an analysis of the absolute origin times problematic but waveform matching of VLP to LP and HF components suggests that the main VLP pulse precedes the HF and LP source processes. Waveform inversion for the VLP source is consistent with the rupture of a high angle East-West oriented crack opening either in a purely tensile or shear-tensile manner. The moment of the isotropic component is estimated at 1.2 × 1012 Nm and the corresponding volumetric change is in the range 145–450 m3. Results are interpreted as an upward migration of fluids which first excite the VLP from a high angle crack in the magma carapace followed by the excitation of LP and HF source processes in the overlying hydrothermal system.},

abstract = {In the upper part of the Stromboli volcano, in the Le Croci and Bastimento areas, two dyke-like bodies of volcanic breccia up to two-metre thick crosscut and intrude the products of Vancori and Neostromboli volcanoes. We describe the lithofacies association of these unusual volcaniclastic dykes, interpret the setting of dyke-forming fractures and the emplacement mechanism of internal deposits, and discuss their probable relationships with the explosive eruption and major lateral collapse events that occurred at the end of the Neostromboli period. The dyke volcaniclastic deposits contain juvenile magmatic fragments (pyroclasts) suggesting a primary volcanic origin. Their petrographic characteristics are coincident with the Neostromboli products. The architecture of the infilling deposits comprises symmetrically-nested volcaniclastic units, separated by sub-vertical boundaries, which are parallel to the dyke margins. The volcanic units are composed of distinctive lithofacies. The more external facies is composed of fine and coarse ash showing sub-vertical laminations, parallel to the contact wall. The central facies comprises stratified, lithic-rich breccia and lapilli-tuff, whose stratification is sub-horizontal and convolute, discordant to the dyke margins. Only at Le Croci dyke, the final unit shows a massive tuff-breccia facies. The volcaniclastic dykes experienced a polyphasic geological evolution comprising three stages. The first phase consisted in fracturing, explosive intrusion related to magma rising and upward injection of magmatic fluids and pyroclasts. The second phase recorded the dilation of fractures and their role as pyroclastic conduits in an explosive eruption possibly coeval with the lateral collapse of the Neostromboli lava cone. Finally, in the third phase, the immediately post-eruption mass-flow remobilization of pyroclastic deposits took place on the volcano slopes.},

abstract = {A primary goal in volcano seismology is to characterize source motions internal to a volcano in terms of their representative forces. In a similar manner, much volcano infrasound research strives to recover eruptive force time histories corresponding to material accelerations occurring at Earth's free surface. These motions may correspond to explosive emission of gas and pyroclasts (e.g., Banister, 1984), rapid ground distensions of a volcanic dome (e.g., Johnson and Lees, 2010), and/or gravity driven rock fall or pyroclastic flows (e.g., Yamasato, 1997). When free surface motion is unsteady it imposes stresses upon the surrounding atmosphere, which are propagated as acoustic airwaves. Typically, the sounds produced by volcanic phenomena are recorded with low‐frequency infrasound sensitive microphones. The intervening atmosphere is relatively homogeneous and nonattenuating for infrasound propagation of a few kilometers, therefore the recorded excess pressures closely represent volcano source time functions. Such force time histories are equivalent to volumetric accelerations of the atmosphere at or near to the source.Many volcano explosion signals begin with intense, impulsive bipolar pulses (compression followed by rarefaction) with durations of a few seconds or less (e.g., Morrissey and Chouet, 1997). These volcano explosion waveforms are often similar to chemical explosion signals recorded in the far field and are suggestive of a rapid release and expansion of gases (Kitov et al., 1997). Several volcano infrasound studies have made use of the Lighthill (1978) simple acoustic source to characterize ejection of fluid from the volcanic vent (e.g., Johnson, 2003).Volcanic explosions generate bipolar infrasound pulses with durations of a few seconds (Firstov and Kravchenko, 1996; Johnson, 2003) that have been attributed to simple acoustic sources. A simple acoustic source, or a monopole, corresponds to a point approximation of fluid injection or extraction. Although most volcanic vents possess length scales of tens of meters to {\ldots}},

abstract = {The dynamics of separated two-phase flow of basaltic magmas in cylindrical conduits has been explored combining large-scale experiments and theoretical studies. Experiments consisted of the continuous injection of air into water or glucose syrup in a 0.24 m diameter, 6.5 m long bubble column. The model calculates vesicularity and pressure gradient for a range of gas superficial velocities (volume flow rates/pipe area, 10{\&}{\#}8722;2{\&}{\#}8211;102 m/s), conduit diameters (100{\&}{\#}8211;2 m), and magma viscosities (3{\&}{\#}8211;300 Pa s). The model is calibrated with the experimental results to extrapolate key flow parameters such as Co (distribution parameter) and Froude number, which control the maximum vesicularity of the magma in the column, and the gas rise speed of gas slugs. It predicts that magma vesicularity increases with increasing gas volume flow rate and decreases with increasing conduit diameter, until a threshold value (45 vol.{\%}), which characterizes churn and annular flow regimes. Transition to annular flow regimes is expected to occur at minimum gas volume flow rates of 103{\&}{\#}8211;104 m3/s. The vertical pressure gradient decreases with increasing gas flow rates and is controlled by magma vesicularity (in bubbly flows) or the length and spacing of gas slugs. This study also shows that until conditions for separated flow are met, increases in magma viscosity favor stability of slug flow over bubbly flow but suggests coexistence between gas slugs and small bubbles, which contribute to a small fraction of the total gas outflux. Gas flow promotes effective convection of the liquid, favoring magma homogeneity and stable conditions.},

abstract = {A series of 88 Vulcanian explosions occurred at the Soufri??re Hills volcano, Montserrat, between August and October, 1997. Conduit conditions conducive to creating these and other Vulcanian explosions were explored via analysis of eruptive products and one-dimensional numerical modeling of magma ascent through a cylindrical conduit. The number densities and textures of plagioclase microlites were documented for twenty-three samples from the events. The natural samples all show very high number densities of microlites, and {\textgreater} 50{\%} by number of microlites have areas {\textless} 20????m2. Pre-explosion conduit conditions and decompression history have been inferred from these data by comparison with experimental decompressions of similar groundmass compositions. Our comparisons suggest quench pressures {\textless} 30??MPa (origin depths {\textless} 2??km) and multiple rapid decompressions of {\textgreater} 13.75??MPa each during ascent from chamber to surface. Values are consistent with field studies of the same events and statistical analysis of explosion time-series data. The microlite volume number density trend with depth reveals an apparent transition from growth-dominated crystallization to nucleation-dominated crystallization at pressures of ??? 7??MPa and lower. A concurrent sharp increase in bulk density marks the onset of significant open-system degassing, apparently due to a large increase in system permeability above ??? 70{\%} vesicularity. This open-system degassing results in a dense plug which eventually seals the conduit and forms conditions favorable to Vulcanian explosions. The corresponding inferred depth of overpressure at 250-700??m, near the base of the dense plug, is consistent with depth to center of pressure estimated from deformation measurements. Here we also illustrate that one-dimensional models representing ascent of a degassing, crystal-rich magma are broadly consistent with conduit profiles constructed via our petrologic analysis. The comparison between models and petrologic data suggests that the dense conduit plug forms as a result of high overpressure and open-system degassing through conduit walls. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The equations governing the movement of the melt and the matrix of a partially molten material are obtained from the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy using expressions from the theory of mixtures. The equations define a length scale $\delta$c called the compaction length, which depends only on the material properties of the melt and matrix. A number of simple solutions to the equations show that, if the porosity is initially constant, matrix compaction only occurs within a distance ∼$\delta$c of an impermeable boundary. Elsewhere the gravitational forces are supported by the viscous stresses resulting from the movement of melt, and no compaction occurs. The velocity necessary to prevent compaction is known as the minimum fluidization velocity. In all cases the compaction rate is controlled by the properties of the matrix. These results can only be applied to geological problems if the values of the permeability, bulk and shear viscosity of the matrix can be estimated. All three depend on the microscopic geometry of the melt, which is in turn controlled by the dihedral angle. The likely equilibrium network provides some guidance in estimating the order of magnitude of these constants, but is no substitute for good measurements, which are yet to be carried out. Partial melting by release of pressure at constant entropy is then examined as a means of produced melt within the earth.The principal results of geological interest are that a mean mantle temperature of 1350°C is capable of producing the oceanic crustal thickness by partial melting. Local hot jets with temperatures of 1550°C can produce aseismic ridges with crustal thicknesses of about 20 km on ridge axes, and can generate enough melt to produce the Hawaiian Ridge. Higher mantle temperatures in the Archaean can produce komatiites if these are the result of modest amounts of melting at depths of greater than 100 km, and not shallow melting of most of the rock. The compaction rate of the partially molten rock is likely to be rapid, and melt-saturated porosities in excess of perhaps 3 per cent are unlikely to persist anywhere over geological times. The movement of melt through a matrix does not transport major and trace elements with the mean velocity of the melt, but with a slower velocity whose magnitude depends on the distribution coefficient. This effect is particularly important when the melt fraction is small, and may both explain some geochemical observations and provide a means of investigating the compaction process within the earth.},

abstract = {The mechanisms of bubble formation and the dynamics of bubble growth in common magmas have been investigated. Experimental and theoretical data suggest that the levels of volatile supersaturation pressure required for nucleation are low ({\textless} 10 bars) due to the occurrence of surface active components in common magmas. The growth history is, moreover, insensitive to the assumptions made on nucleation, except during early stages of growth. Nucleation theory indicates that there is a minimum diameter of bubble that can be preserved in tephra which is of the order of a few microns. A numerical method has been developed to determine bubble growth rates during volcanic eruptions of basaltic and rhyolitic magmas. The numerical solutions consider both diffusional and decompressional growth and the effects of magma ascent rates (0–400 cm s−1), magma viscosity (102 to 108 poise), gas solubility, gas content (0.25–5{\%}) and gas diffusivity (10−6 to 10−9 cm2 s−1) on growth rates. Bubbles are predicted to grow to between 5.0 and 0.1 cm diameter in typical basaltic explosive eruptions (Strombolian type) and between 200 and 10 $\mu$m in typical rhyolitic explosive eruptions (plinian and ignimbrite type). The smaller bubble sizes in rhyolitic tephras is shown to be due to the lower diffusivity of H2O in acid melts and the generally higher rates of eruption in plinian and ignimbrite type eruptions rather than to the high viscosity. Non-equilibrium effects produce excess internal pressures within growing bubbles. These are a static surface tension pressure and dynamic pressure terms due to viscous resistance of the liquid to growth and the inertia of the liquid. These pressure terms are shown to be small compared to supersaturation pressures driving growth in freely growing bubbles in magmas with viscosities up to 107 poise and magma ascent velocities up to 400 cm s−1. For viscosities of 108 poise and above the viscous pressure term is calculated with values of tens of bars and has a major role in inhibiting growth. It is proposed that most bubbles cease growth well before explosive disruption of the magmatic froth. This is postulated to occur at volume ratios of gas bubbles to liquid of the order 3:1 to 5:1. At this stage bubbles cannot expand further because of the increasing viscosity of the melt as exsolution takes place and because high viscosity liquid has to be forced along very thin paths between closely spaced neighbouring bubbles. Vesicle walls are sufficiently thin that pressures close to equilibrium between gas bubble pressure and the vapor pressure of the gas dissolved in the liquid are established before the magma is disrupted. Equilibrium partitioning of gas between vesicles and liquid produces gas pressures of tens to hundreds of bars. The disruption of the magma is proposed to occur by bursting of the larger bubbles within the froth at the free surface of the magma due to a pressure difference across this interface.},

High precision tilt also allows detecting the slight ground deformation linked to strombolian activity (0.01-0.2. microradians) as well as co-seismic variations (0.1-1.5. microradians) and tidal effects (0.1-0.2. microradians) that may have a role in the evolution of a volcanic system.Time-amplitude tilt ranges linked to each process are generally different allowing to discriminate, in real time, between a signal associated to one process and another one.This fact is important in terms of early warning particularly during the first phases of dikes propagation that precede a lateral eruption by hours-days. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The persistent normal activity of Stromboli is occasionally interrupted by sudden and highly energetic explosive events called Strombolian paroxysms. These phenomena together with landslide-generated tsunamis represent the most hazardous manifestations of present- day volcanic activity at Stromboli. The most recent paroxysms, on 5 April 2003 and 15 March 2007, have drawn attention to these energetic events because they significantly threatened inhabitants and tourists. Historical accounts and field evidence indicate, however, that even larger paroxysms, in terms of volume, dispersal of products and intensity of explosive phenomena, occurred in the recent past. During these paroxysms incipiently welded spatter deposits mantled the north and south rims of the Sciara del Fuoco down to low elevations, extending much farther than the similar deposits from recent observed events (5 April 2003 and 15 March 2007). In order to identify, characterize and discriminate among products of these outstanding spatter-forming eruptions, more than 50 stratigraphic sections were measured and sampled. Strati- graphic, sedimentological and radiometric (14C) data indicate that only two paroxysms produced spatter that reached very low elevations and inhabited areas: the first occurred in the 16th century and the last in AD 1930. Analysis of texture and deposit components reveals that the early phases of the two eruptions were driven by distinctly different eruptive dynamics. Both identified paroxysms are at least one order of magnitude greater than any similar event observed by monitoring systems at Stromboli. These two large paroxysms were the most powerful volcanic events at Stromboli in the last eighteen centuries.},

The solution is applied to the interpretation of infrasonic and seismic signals preceding and accompanying volcanic eruptions, and can be used to study the acoustic response of various types of volcanic fluids, including magma-gas mixtures, ash-gas mixtures, and bubble-rich liquids. The acoustic field in a magma conduit can be propagated into the atmosphere through an open vent, and coupled into the ground through the displacement of the magma conduit walls. The theoretical solutions predict that fluids moving with the non-negligible Mach number will exhibit significant attenuation in the upstream direction, therby reducing the quality factor of the conduit resonance. Thus, acoustic energy generated during an eruption may be preferentially radiated downstream, exacerbating the acoustic decoupling between the upper and lower parts of a stratified magma column.

abstract = {The flow dynamics of magmas is controlled by several parameters, including magma rheology, density, surface tension, gas and liquid flow rate, and the geometry of the flow field, which is mainly regulated by the conduit shape. For this reason, magmatic flows along fis-sures and dikes are significantly different from those along axisymmetric conduits. Basaltic eruptions are typically fed by fractures or dike systems that reach the surface, giving rise to fissure eruptions. Scaled experiments show that in these low-viscosity systems, gas transport and segregation (i.e., the outgassing dynamics) are deeply controlled by the fracture geometry. Rapid bubble clustering and formation of bubble plumes determine the formation of lateral magma convection cells involving up to 70 vol{\%} of the melt. In analogy with outgassing in cylindrical conduits, the average vesicularity and size of bubbles increase with increasing gas flow rate and melt viscosity and density, which also control the lateral extent of the bubble plume and convection cells.},

abstract = {Masaya volcano, Nicaragua, is a persistently active volcano characterized by continuous passive degassing for more than 150years through the open vent of Santiago crater. This study applies self-potential, soil CO 2 and ground temperature measurements to highlight the existence of uprising fluids associated to diffuse degassing structures throughout the volcano. The diffuse degassing areas are organized in a semi-circular pattern and coincide with several visible and inferred surface volcanic structures (cones, fissure vents) and likely consist of a network of buried faults and dykes that respectively channel uprising flow and act as barrier to gravitational groundwater flow. Water depths have been estimated by multi-scale wavelet tomography of the self-potential data using wavelets from the Poisson kernel family. Compared to previous water flow models, our water depth estimates are shallower and mimic the topography, typically less than 150m below the surface. Between 2006 and 2010, the depths of rising fluids along the survey profiles remained stable suggesting that hydrothermal activity is in a steady state. This stable activity correlates well with the consistency of the volcanic activity expressed at the surface by the continuously passive degassing.When compared to previous structural models of the caldera floor, it appears that the diffuse degassing structures have an important effect on the path that shallow groundwater follows to reach the Laguna de Masaya in the eastern part of the caldera. The hydrogeological system is therefore more complex than previously published models and our new structural model implies that the flow of shallow groundwater must bypass the intrusions to reach the Laguna de Masaya. Furthermore, these diffuse degassing structures show clear evidence of activity and must be connected to a shallow magmatic or hydrothermal reservoir beneath the caldera. As such, the heat budget for Masaya must be significantly larger than previously estimated. ?? 2012 .},

abstract = {High total and fluid pressures develop in the interior of high-viscosity lava domes and in the uppermost parts of the feeding conduit system as a consequence of degassing. Two effects are recognised and are modelled quantitatively. First, large increases in magma viscosity result from degassing during magma ascent. Strong vertical gradients in viscosity result and large excess pressures and pressure gradients develop at the top of the conduit and in the dome. Calculations of conduit flow show that almost all the excess pressure drop from the chamber in an andesitic dome eruption occurs during the last several hundred metres of ascent. Second, microlites grow in the melt phase as a consequence of undercooling caused by gas loss. Rapid microlite growth can cause large excess fluid pressures to develop at shallow levels. Theoretically closed-system microlite crystallization can increase local pressure by a few tens of MPa, although build up of pressure will be countered by gas loss through permeable flow and expansion by viscous flow. Microlite crystallization is most effective in causing excess gas pressures at depths of a few hundred metres in the uppermost parts of the conduit and dome interior. Some of the major phenomena of lava dome eruptions can be attributed to these pressurisation effects, including spurts of growth, cycles of dome growth and subsidence, sudden onset of violent explosive activity and disintegration of lava during formation of pyroclastic flows. The characteristic shallow-level, long-period and hybrid seismicity, characteristic of dome eruptions, is attributed to the excess fluid pressures, which are maintained close to the fracture strength of the dome and wallrock, resulting in fluid movement during formation of tensile and shear fractures within the dome and upper conduit.},

Calibration checks showed that the time averaged output of the instrument was close to linear over the whole range of void fraction, with a tendency to overestimate the true value. Computer modelling of the probe's response to different void distributions supported the calibration results. Two meters were used to examine the dynamic variation of void fraction in air water flows in a vertical 32 mm diameter tube. Flow patterns ranging from bubbly to annular were observed. Examination of the void fraction traces and their probability distribution functions enabled the identification of six flow regimes: discrete bubble flow, spherical cap bubble flow, stable slug flow, unstable slug flow, churn flow and annular flow. The locations of flow regime transition boundaries on a flow pattern map, deduced from this objective analysis, are in agreement with the data of other workers. The unstable slug flow regime corresponds to a region some workers have identified as churn flow, it provides explanations for some of the apparent anomalies concerning the location of the slug to churn flow boundary. Cross-correlation of the signals from the two probes has provided statistical data on the lengths of slugs and Taylor bubbles which suggested modifications to the previous theories enabling the entry to and exit from the unstable slug flow regime to be predicted.},

abstract = {Source mechanisms of explosive volcanic eruptions are critical for understanding magmatic plumbing systems and magma transport. Tungurahua is a large andesitic stratovolcano where seismoacoustic data has been recorded over several years. In May 2010, an energetic eruption cycle began with a midsize Vulcanian explosion followed by swarms of explosive eruptions. The five-station seismoacoustic network recorded significant seismic and infrasonic signals from the explosions. Source mechanisms of 50 explosion earthquakes associated with Vulcanian explosions during this eruptive period are investigated here. The source centroid locations and geometries of explosive signals in the 10–2 s band were determined by full-waveform moment tensor inversion. The observed waveforms are well explained by a combination of volumetric moment tensor components and a single, vertical, downward force component. The source centroids are positioned about 1.5 km below and about 320 m north of the active crater. Eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis indicates that the source geometries can be described by a subhorizontal, thin ellipsoid representing a sill-like magma accumulation. Resultant source time histories show a repetitive sequence of inflation and deflation from event to event, indicating identical source processes frequently occurred over the period. The inflation/deflation in the deep source region may be the result of crack opening. Volatile bubble growth at depth opens a pathway for gases to escape and triggers shallow explosions at the summit crater. The associated downward single force is interpreted as an exchange of linear momentum between the source and the surrounding region during the escaping gas flow.},

abstract = {Decrease of the velocity of a pressure wave in magma by the presence of bubbles is regarded as a fundamental process in seismoacoustic activities of a volcano. However, we show that the large viscosity of magma (???105 Pa s) prevents this decrease in wave velocity. To investigate how the acoustic properties of a liquid-bubble mixture depend on liquid rheology, laboratory experiments were conducted using silicone oil and syrup. Both liquids have a viscosity as high as 1000 Pa s. Propagation of a pressure wave and the radial motion of a bubble were observed in a shock-tube-type apparatus, but were quite different in the two liquids. Although the velocity of the pressure wave significantly decreased as the void fraction in silicone oil did, bubbles did not decrease the wave velocity in syrup. From conducting several material tests, we found that both liquids are viscoelastic, and that the rigidity (the shear elasticity) of silicone oil is smaller than that of the syrup by several orders. The motion of a single bubble and propagation of the pressure wave were calculated using the Oldroyd model for linear viscoelasticity. The numerical solutions explained the difference as a result of the different rigidities of the two liquids. The same mathematical model was then applied to understand pressure wave propagation in bubbly magmas with a variety of viscosities. Results of the experiments and the subsequent numerical analyses suggest that pressure wave propagation in a liquid-bubble mixture and the motion of a single bubble depend significantly on the viscoelastic properties of the liquid. The sound velocities of liquids with large viscosities and rigidities are not decreased by bubbles; magmas with high viscosity are in this category. To evaluate propagation velocity and attenuation of a pressure wave in a bubbly liquid, we need to deal with the dispersion relationship with an adequate liquid rheology model. The present results give an insight into the bubble dynamics in a viscoelastic liquid, which is important for developing mathematical and experimental methods to investigate seismoacoustic phenomena in volcanoes. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The UAV capability for imaging fissures and displacements on the landslide surface has been evaluated, and the subsequent image processing approaches for suitably georectifying the data have been assessed. For Super-Sauze, horizontal displacements of 7 to 55. m between a high-resolution airborne ortho-photo of May 2007 and a UAV-based ortho-mosaic of October 2008 have been measured. Fixed areas of persistent deformation have been identified, producing fissures of different distributions and orientations comparable to glacial crevasses, and relating directly to the bedrock topography. The UAV has demonstrated its capability for producing valuable landslide data but improvements are required to reduce data processing time for the efficient generation of ortho-mosaics based on photogrammetric DTMs, in order to minimise georeferencing errors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract Explosive volcanic eruptions can eject large amounts of ash into the atmosphere, posing a serious threat to populations living near the volcano. The abrupt occurrence of such events requires a rapid response and proper volcanic hazard evaluation. Current monitoring procedures still require human intervention, which often results in significant delays between the occurrence of an eruption and notifications being dispatched. We show how dedicated infrasound array processing can be used to detect and notify the authorities, automatically and in real time, of the onset of explosive eruptions. Conceptually, our method relies on the strong coupling between infrasound and the explosive process, and it is not based on probabilistic considerations but on the ability infrasound has to detect the early stage of the explosive phase. This procedure has been tested for the last 8 years, and it is currently applied to issue early warnings for explosive eruptions at Etna Volcano. We show that the system is able to provide a prealert {\~{}}1 hour before the eruption, and it has a 96.6{\%} success rate, with only 1.7{\%} false positive alerts and no false negative alerts. This is, to our knowledge, the first example of an operational early warning system totally based on an unsupervised algorithm that provides automatic notifications of eruptions to a government agency. We show that the same early warning concept might be applicable to arrays at large distances ({\textgreater}500 km), suggesting that infrasound could be successfully used to issue automatic notifications of on‐going eruptions at regional to global scales.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016. The Authors.Recent gas flux measurements have shown that Strombolian explosions are often followed by periods of elevated flux, or “gas codas,” with durations of order a minute. Here we present UV camera data from 200 events recorded at Stromboli volcano to constrain the nature of these codas for the first time, providing estimates for combined explosion plus coda SO2 masses of ≈18–225 kg. Numerical simulations of gas slug ascent show that substantial proportions of the initial gas mass can be distributed into a train of “daughter bubbles” released from the base of the slug, which we suggest, generate the codas, on bursting at the surface. This process could also cause transitioning of slugs into cap bubbles, significantly reducing explosivity. This study is the first attempt to combine high temporal resolution gas flux data with numerical simulations of conduit gas flow to investigate volcanic degassing dynamics.},

abstract = {Explosive volcanic eruptions typically show a huge column of ash and debris ejected into the stratosphere, crackling with lightning. Yet equally hazardous are the fast moving avalanches of hot gas and rock that can rush down the volcano's flanks at speeds approaching 280 kilometers per hour. Called pyroclastic flows, these surges can reach temperatures of 400{\textordmasculine}C. Fast currents and hot temperatures can quickly overwhelm communities living in the shadow of volcanoes, such as what happened to Pompeii and Herculaneum after the 79 C.E. eruption of Italy's Mount Vesuvius or to Saint- Pierre after Martinique's Mount Pel{\'{e}}e erupted in 1902. The ability to detect volcanic explosions and track pyroclastic flows in a timely fashion is crucial to volcano monitoring operations and can positively affect risk management on many volcanoes, particularly those where collapsing lava domes tend to trigger pyroclastic flows. Increasingly, monitoring active explosive volcanoes involves studying infrasound. Infrasound is the low- frequency component of sound, ranging from 0.001 to about 20 hertz, below the human threshold of hearing. Many natural phenomena such as earthquakes, avalanches, landslides, tornadoes, and tsunamis are efficient sources of infrasound. Volcanoes are especially prolific infrasonic radiators: On active explosive volcanoes, volumetric sources rapidly expanding in the atmosphere produce infrasound, providing valuable insights into eruption dynamics. In particular, volcanoes characterized by lava dome growth exhibit infrasound generated by nonexplosive sources related to dome collapses, such as pyroclastic flows [Yamasato, 1997], rockfalls [Moran et al., 2008], and lahars. Such acoustic monitoring is fast becoming a standard technique on active volcanoes worldwide because of its potential to rapidly assess eruptive activity. The Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills volcano (SHV), on the West Indies island of Montserrat, represents one of the best examples of a hazardous volcano that can be readily monitored through infrasonic studies. After several centuries of quiescence, SHV explosively erupted in 1995 and has since followed a characteristic cycle of dome growth and collapse activity accompanied by explosions and pyroclastic flows [Young et al., 1998]. Large domes and kilometers- high explosive columns have collapsed multiple times, generating large and devastating pyroclastic density currents that thus far have killed 19 people, destroyed the capital city of Plymouth, overrun its airport, forced its total evacuation, and prompted more than half of the island's population to leave. At present, a lava dome with a volume of about 200 million cubic meters stands at the summit of SHV [Scientific Advisory Committee, 2008]. It is capable of collapsing and exploding at any time. To help provide adequate warning of volcanic hazards, the monitoring system at SHV was recently enhanced with the installation of a permanent small-aperture infrasonic array less than 3 kilometers away from the lava dome. This array has already proved its ability to detect explosive eruptions and track pyroclastic flows in real time, improving the efficiency of the response of the Montserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO) during eruption crises and providing useful data that will help to constrain theoretical models aimed at unraveling the complex dynamics of pyroclastic flow propagation.},

abstract = {The explosive source mechanism, responsible for the volcanic activity of Stromboli, is analyzed by seismic and infrasonic measurements in correlation with digitally processed images of the explosive events. Infrasonic recordings associated with short-period seismic signals give evidence that the high-frequency ({\textgreater}5 Hz) wave field is produced by a seismic source coupled to the atmosphere. The time delay between seismic and infrasonic onsets is not stable and the fluctuations could reflect a change in the magma-gas physical properties and/or a migration of the source in the magma conduit. The gas jet velocity, calculated by videocamera images, and the time delay between seismic and infrasonic onset show a weak inverse correlation. The foam collapse model has been checked in laboratory experiments by recording acoustic signals produced during gas bubbles growth, flow, and burst in a liquid. The observed signals present strong similarities to short-period ({\textgreater}1 s) as well as broadband (10{\^{a}}€“1 s) seismic signals recorded at Stromboli. Low-frequency rarefaction is observed when the foam collapse occurs and the gas bubble starts to rise up along the pipe, then the bubble film breaking at the liquid free surface emits an audible sound. By analogy, we infer that low-frequency seismic decompression is generated by the rapid expansion of gas in the magma conduit, while high-frequency seismic signal and infrasound are generated by the explosion at the magma free-surface. The time differences between seismic, infrasonic and visible onset of the explosion locate the explosive source at 600 m above sea level.},

@article{Mader1998,
abstract = {This chapter provides a critical overview of syn-eruptive processes between magma chamber and vent in magmatic, sustained, Plinian-type eruptions. Phreatomagmatic effects are largely neglected. The main sources of information derive from textural studies of ejecta, theoretical models and physical experiments of eruption dynamics. Textural studies commonly find bimodal vesicle populations, indicative of several discrete nucleation events. The degree of disorder increases with explosivity. Dynamical parameters, such as nucleation density and rate and bubble growth rate, can be inferred from studies of the moments of bubble size distributions. Vesicularity in pumices is observed to vary significantly both within and between deposits, which suggests that the vesicularity at fragmentation is affected by the flow dynamics. Vesicularity variations correlate most closely with changes in magmatic composition and viscosity, but not with discharge rate. Conduit flow models can be broadly grouped into first- and second-generation models; the former generally impose a lithostatic pressure gradient and a constant Newtonian viscosity, whereas the latter include equations for the rheological changes that take place during vesiculation and solve for the pressure. Second-generation models derive highly non-lithostatic pressure gradients with the result that most of the vesiculation occurs at a high rate over a short distance just prior to fragmentation. The mechanisms of brittle and ductile fragmentation have been investigated in separate studies in non-vesiculating magmas, but which mechanism operates in explosive eruptions is not known. Dynamical laboratory experiments provide observations of the physical processes operating in conduit flows. Gas-expansion experiments have shown that it is possible to generate violent explosions by unloading in cool magmatic materials. Expanding dusty flows are found to be stable only if the bulk density increases with height. Exsolution experiments have demonstrated that acceleration precedes fragmentation and that gas evolution is enhanced by advection and bubble deformation. Deformed vesicles similar to those found in ‘woody' pumice have been generated in an analogue system that has similar rheology to that found in vesiculating magmas. Large-scale exsolution experiments suggest that explosive volcanic eruptions are inherently heterogeneous: the fluctuations in discharge rate and discrete pulses and shocks commonly observed are a consequence of the large physical scale of volcanic systems. The effect of the magma chamber and conduit geometry has also been investigated. Eruption of material from a spherical flask up a narrow cylindrical tube generates quasi-steady flow conditions after an initial transient during which the discharge rate grows, as frequently observed in volcanic eruptions. The fragmentation surface does not propagate down into the magma chamber.},

abstract = {At many volcanoes, low magma-viscosities allow persistent degassing over a range of styles from explosive Strombolian activity to gas 'puffing' and passive degassing. It is generally accepted that Strombolian eruptions reflect the bursting of large bubbles (gas slugs) at the magma surface and that relatively quiescent 'puffing' indicates the presence of significantly smaller bubbles or slugs. Here, we address this qualitative range and derive a dimensionless parameter, Pslim
*, to quantify and distinguish different regimes of 'burst vigour'. For Pslim

* {\textgreater} 1, bursting slugs will be energetic, and surface effects are anticipated to increase with increasing Pslim
*. Various physical parameters recorded during laboratory experiments and simulated through numerical models are shown to demonstrate the same trends when parameterised by Pslim
*. Hence, Pslim
* provides a straightforward relationship between changes in measurable surface effects and the system's subsurface physical parameters and, for energetic activity of a particular system, burst effects are shown to be proportional to the square root of the gas mass involved. Effect magnitudes are also shown to be a function of atmospheric pressure and application of Pslim

abstract = {Over an 18 h interval in April 1994, the tremor at Lascar volcano, Chile, was characterized by a spectrum with narrow peaks at a fundamental frequency of about 0.63 Hz and more than 25 overtones at exact integer multiples. This harmonic tremor was recorded at four three-component, high-dynamic range stations during the deployment of the Proyecto de Investigacion Sismologica de la Cordillera Occidental 94 (PISCO'94). Usually this tremor's source is modeled as the resonance of a fluid-filled crack or organ pipe-like structure in the volcano. The resonance of a real, physical structure, however, can produce neither as many overtones nor such exact multiples as those observed in the harmonic tremor at Lascar. Harmonics also occur in a spectrum if the source signal is repetitive but nonsinusoidal. Fluid dynamics offers at least three realistic source models for harmonic tremor which produce repetitive, nonsinusoidal waveforms: the release of gas through a very small outlet (the soda bottle model), slug flow in a narrow conduit, and von Karman vortices produced at obstacles. These models represent different flow regimes, each with its own characteristic range of Reynolds numbers. For each model the fundamental frequency of the tremor is related to the Reynolds number for the flow. Combining the Reynolds numbers for each model with typical kinematic viscosities for the possible fluids present in a volcano-magma, water, steam, air or some combination, at appropriate temperatures and pressures-provides limits on such physical parameters of the volcano as the dimensions of the flow conduit and the flow velocity of the fluid generating the tremor. If any single one of these three models is actually the process in the volcano which generates harmonic tremor, then the tremor is caused by movements of water or gases in the hydrothermal system near the volcano's surface.

abstract = {Strombolian explosions at Heimaey and Stromboli are described. Two main components of activity within a typical strombolian explosion are distinguished: an initial, high velocity, gas thrust part due to gas decompression and a subsequent convective part. Initial gas velocities at Heimaey averaged 157 m/s (standard deviation 28 m/s from 15 observations) and at Stromboli 31 m/s (standard deviation 12 m/s from 8 observations) for one vent and 56 m/s for a second vent. Velocities decreased approximately exponentially with height, and decelerations of up to 50 gravities were observed during the gas thrust events. A model of the gas thrust process is developed and values are deduced for the gas/solid mass ratio in the ejected material. Evidence is resented for the several-foId concentration of gas into that part f the magma expelled explosively, and a model in which large bursting gas bubbles are responsible for the explosions is shown to be compatible with the observations. Excess pressure within such bubbles is found to be of order 2.5 x 104N/m (0.25 atmospheres) at Heimaey and 600N/m2 (0.006 atmospheres) at Stromboli. Pressures inside bubbles of a few metres diameter are found to be of comparable magnitudes. Average gas release rates of 3 to 6 x 103 kgm/s at Heimaey and at least 0.13 kgm/s at Stromboli are indicated.},

abstract = {Microtextural characteristics of fresh ejecta from Stromboli volcano were examined from three periods of differing eruption style and intensity in 2002. Activity shifted from relatively weak and infrequent ash-charged explosions during January through May into two broad cycles of waxing activity in June through late September, and late September through December, followed by the onset on 28 December of the 2002/2003 effusive eruption. Analyzed sets of lapilli from May, September/October, and 28 December show contrasts in the physical properties of magma resident in the shallow conduit during this range of activity. Three distinct textures are observed among the analyzed pyroclasts: low density (LD) with an abundance of subspherical bubbles, the presence of large, irregularly shaped bubbles, and a light-to-transparent glass matrix; transitional texture (TT) with an intermediate number of subspherical bubbles, a high frequency of large, irregularly-shaped bubbles, and a honey colored glass matrix; and high density (HD) with sparse relatively small bubbles, conspicuous large irregular bubbles, and a dark glass matrix. Observational and quantitative data (density, vesicle size) indicate that these textures are linked through variable residence time in Stromboli's shallow conduit, with an ongoing evolution from LD to HD magma. Calculations suggest that residual LD magma will evolve to HD texture in a period of hours to days. Contrasting amounts of the LD, TT, and HD magmas are present in each sample, with the most TT in May, the most LD in September/October, and the most HD in December. This implies that the shallow magma had a different rheology at each collection period. The viscosity of LD and HD magmas are calculated to be in the range of 2,000 to 2,600 and 3,000 to 5,000 Pa s, respectively, which, with their changing proportions, must have implications for rates of bubble slug ascent and processes of fragmentation. This study suggests that an increasing maturity of magma in Stromboli's shallow conduit (with resultant increase in viscosity) feeds back to reduce the intensity of explosions, whereas a steady flux of LD magma favors more powerful explosions.},

Lavas are strongly porphyritic with principal phenocrysts of clinopyroxene, leucite and calcic plagioclase. Olivine, biotite, FeTi oxides and apatite are present occasionally. Their bulk composition defines a chemical group spanning the leucite-tephrite and phonolite-tephrite regions of the TAS (total alkalies vs. silica) diagram. Through PERs (Pearce element ratios) analysis it has been possible to determine the lava differentiation relationships (controlled by cpx joined by minor lc, plag and Ti-mt) and to estimate the extent of differentiation processes (about 25{\%} of initial mass). Chemistry of cpx indicates a multistage crystallization process in the upper crust. The crystallization environmental parameters deduced from the experimental cpx and liquids are consistent with the existence of a shallow magma chamber within the carbonate rocks of the Triassic basement where the nearly dry Vesuvius magma becomes CO2 saturated. The generally small volume of the products from single eruptions, and Vesuvius lavas geochemical and petrographic features suggest magma reservoir is zoned with respect to temperature and phenocrysts abundance. The dynamics of magma withdrawal controls mixing of the melt fractions proceeding from different areas of the magma chamber and, therefore, it produces the within-flow chemical differences. Chemical variations among the lavas of different eruptive cycles are instead believed to be controlled essentially by the speed of magma ascent through the upper crust allowing differential removals of cpx phenocrysts crystallized from the magma on its way to the surface. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The non-chondritic neodymium (Nd)142Nd/144Nd ratio of the silicate Earth potentially provides a key constraint on the accretion and early evolution of the Earth. Yet, it is debated whether this offset is due to the Earth being formed from material enriched in s-process Nd isotopes or results from an early differentiation process such as the segregation of a late sulfide matte during core formation, collisional erosion or a some combination of these processes. Neodymium stable isotopes are potentially sensitive to early sulfide segregation into Earth's core, a process that cannot be resolved using their radiogenic counterparts. This study presents the first comprehensive Nd stable isotope data for chondritic meteorites and terrestrial rocks. Stable Nd measurements were made using a double spike technique coupled with thermal ionisation mass spectrometry. All three of the major classes of chondritic meteorites, carbonaceous, enstatite and ordinary chondrites have broadly similar isotopic compositions allowing calculation of a chondritic mean of $\delta$146/144Nd = −0.025 ± 0.025‰ (±2 s.d.; n=39). Enstatite chondrites yield the most uniform stable isotope composition ($\Delta$146/144Nd = 26 ppm), with considerably more variability observed within ordinary ($\Delta$146/144Nd = 72 ppm) and carbonaceous meteorites ($\Delta$146/144Nd = 143 ppm). Terrestrial weathering, nucleosynthetic variations and parent body thermal metamorphism appear to have little measurable effect on $\delta$146/144Nd in chondrites. The small variations observed between ordinary chondrite groups most likely reflect inherited compositional differences between parent bodies, with the larger variations observed in carbonaceous chondrites being linked to varying modal proportions of calcium–aluminium rich inclusions. The terrestrial samples analysed here include rocks ranging from basaltic to rhyolitic in composition, MORB glasses and residual mantle lithologies. All of these terrestrial rocks possess a broadly similar Nd isotope composition giving an average composition for the bulk silicate Earth of $\delta$146/144Nd = −0.022 ± 0.034‰ (n=30). In the samples here magmatic differentiation appears to only have an effect on stable Nd in highly evolved magmas with heavier $\delta$146/144Nd values observed in samples with {\textgreater}70 wt{\%} SiO2. The average stable Nd isotope composition of chondrites and the bulk silicate Earth are indistinguishable at the 95{\%} confidence level. However, mantle samples do possess variable stable Nd isotope compositions ($\Delta$146/144Nd = 75 ppm) with an average $\delta$146/144Nd value of −0.008‰. If these heavier values represent the true composition of pristine mantle then it is not possible to completely rule out some role for core formation in accounting for some of the offset between the mantle and chondrites. Overall, these results indicate that the mismatch of142Nd between the Earth and chondrites is best explained by a higher proportion of s-process Nd in the Earth, rather than partitioning into sulfide or S-rich metal in the core.},

abstract = {Scaled modeling has been conducted to study the role played by the reactivation of vertical basement faults in the destabilization process of overlying volcanoes. Results show that basement fault reactivation induces the formation of faults within the volcanic edifice. These faults delimits a central block which is extruded from between the two undeformed lateral parts of the edifice, Collapse of this central block can occur when heterogeneous cones are used in experiments, revealing that mechanical interfaces are of paramount importance in triggering rockslide avalanches. Collapse structures may display horseshoe shapes in map view and are then surprisingly similar to avalanche scars resulting from failure created by magmatic intrusions in natural volcanoes. Large-scale destabilisation of half the surface of the cone may also occur in a single event depending on the position of the reactivated basement fault below the edifice. It is emphasized that the process under consideration may occur on a dormant volcano as well, provided that a fault is reactivated below it.},

abstract = {Basaltic bombs ejected from a Rotomahana crater during the 1886 Tarawera eruption in New Zealand are of two fundamental types: cored bombs, which have single large fragments, generally of rhyolite wall rock material, as their cores, and "loaded" bombs, which contain abundant small fragments dispersed through the bombs. Similar lithic-bearing bombs are common products of other, phreatomagmatic eruptions worldwide. Cored bombs originate when a large wall rock fragment is entrained in basaltic melt and then ejected with an adhering skin of basalt. In contrast, loaded bombs are constructed by agglomeration of multiple fragments of basalt, among which smaller rhyolitic wall rock fragments are dispersed. Different styles and rates of bomb "loading" are reflected in the bombs' textures and compositions. These textures provide insight into the nature of fragmentation during the eruption, the processes of recycling that produce multiply ejected clasts versus "recapitulated" ones (those where early formed clasts were reingested in magma and then formed the cores of new bombs), the degree and timescale of interaction of magma with vent walls, and the timescales over which lithic material from the vent walls is incorporated into complex bombs prior to their ejection. Because fragments of rhyolitic pumice are readily refused, their condition constrains estimates of the timing of fragmentation and agglomeration. The presence of nonfused rhyolite pumice within many loaded bombs implies that the processes forming and quenching the bombs cannot have exceeded several seconds. In contrast, other bombs contain patches of compositionally modified basalt with isolated rhyolite-derived feldspar xenocrysts that indicate complete fusing, melting and assimilation of entrained rhyolitic debris. The bomb population overall indicates that conditions within this Rotomahana vent were thermally and physically heterogeneous and that recycling of debris was ubiquitous, both as recycling of large individual clasts and by fallback and aggregation of material which was reingested in magma before being reejected as new bombs.

abstract = {Volcanic explosions are accompanied by strong acoustic pressure disturbances in the atmo- sphere. With a proper source model, these acoustic signals provide invaluable information about volcanic explosion dynamics. Far-field solutions to volcanic infrasound radiation have been derived above a rigid half-space boundary, and a simple inversion method was developed based on the half-space model. Acoustic monopole and dipole sourceswere estimated simulta- neously from infrasoundwaveforms. Stability of the inversion procedurewas assessed in terms of variances of source parameters, and the procedure was reliable with at least three stations around the infrasound source. Application of this method to infrasound observations recorded at Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador successfully produced a reasonable range of source pa- rameters with acceptable variances. Observed strong directivity of infrasound radiation from explosions atTungurahua are successfully explained by the directivity of a dipole source model. The resultant dipole axis, in turn, shows good agreement with the opening direction of the vent at Tungurahua,which is considered to be the origin of the dipole source. The method is general and can be utilized to study any monopole, dipole or combined sources generated by explosions},

abstract = {The persistent release of gas at basaltic volcanoes where there is a low magma eruption rate can be driven by an exchange flow of magma in the conduit, in which gas-rich magma ascends, degasses and crystallises and then sinks back down the conduit. The driving force of the flow is provided by the density difference between the buoyant bubble-rich magma at depth and the dense degassed crystallised magma at shallow levels. In this study we attempt to constrain the physical and chemical processes driving an exchange flow of magma at Stromboli, Aeolian Archipelago, Italy. The model uses a simple, cylindrical geometry. We define degassing and crystallisation paths of the ascending and descending magmas, constrained by gas flux and melt inclusion data given in the literature, to produce a three-phase model of ascending and descending magmas driving persistent gas fluxes. We calculate the viscosity of the three-phase magma using end-member rheological models for bubble and crystal suspensions. Combining our modelled magma properties with analogue exchange flow experiments we can relate the regime of magma flow driving persistent degassing to pressure. At pressures ≲ 90. MPa (≲ 3. km) the viscosity ratio is ≲. 100 and the regime is predicted to be side by side flow with both ascending and descending magmas adjacent to a portion of the conduit wall. At pressures ≳. 90. MPa (≳. 3. km) the viscosity ratio between the ascending and descending magma is ≳. 100 and the flow is predicted to be core annular flow, with the ascending vesiculating magma in the inner core and the more crystalline degassed magma flowing down along the conduit wall. By analogy, we hypothesise that degassed magma would flow down along the walls in dike-like plumbing geometries that have been proposed for the deeper Strombolian system. Analogue experiments suggest that exchange flows do not overturn under conditions of maximum volume flux; we use an empirical relationship to characterise the volume flux of the exchange flow and show that the radius of a cylindrical conduit required to account for the observed persistent gas flux at Stromboli at 0.1.

abstract = {The eruptions of December 2015 and May 2016 at Voragine crater were among the most explosive recorded during the last two decades at Mt. Etna volcano. Here we present data coming from geophysics (infrasound, LP, VLP, volcanic tremor, VT earthquakes, and ground deformations) and petrology (textural and microanalytical data on plagioclase and olivine crystals) to investigate the preeruptive magma storage and transfer dynamics leading to these exceptional explosive eruptions. Integration of all the avail-able data has led us to constrain chemically, physically, and kinetically the environments where magmas were stored before the eruption, and how they have interacted during the transfer en-route to the surface. Although the evolution and behavior of volcanic phenomena at the surface was rather similar, some differ-ences in storage and transfer dynamics were observed for 2015 and 2016 eruptions. Specifically, the 2015 eruptions have been fed by magmas stored at shallow levels that were pushed upward as a response of magma injections from deeper environments, whereas evidence of chemical interaction between shallow and deep magmatic environments becomes more prominent during the 2016 eruptions. Main findings evidence the activation of magmatic environments deeper than those generally observed for other recent Etnean eruptions, with involvement of deep basic magmas that were brought to shallow crustal levels in very short time scales (1 month). The fast transfer from the deepest levels of the plumbing system of basic, undegassed magmas might be viewed as the crucial triggering factor leading to development of exceptionally violent volcanic phenomena even with only basic magma involved.},

The strainmeter data, integrated with those recorded by the magnetic network, and with satellite and ground thermal data, allowed us to follow the path of a gas-rich magma batch from the source inside the volcano to the surface and atmosphere. The amplitude ratio of the volumetric strain changes constrained the storage depth of the magma feeding the lava fountains above 1.5 km below sea level. Magnetic data revealed an attempted shallow lateral intrusion, whereas ground and satellite thermal data furnished a quantification of the total erupted volumes of ∼2.2 × 106 m3 for the 15 November event and ∼3.0 × 106 m3 for the 18 March event. Despite different durations of the explosive and effusive phases of the two lava fountain events, the total erupted volume was quite similar, suggesting the emptying of a shallow storage system displaying a steady behaviour.},

abstract = {Macroseismic and instrumental data concerning earthquakes that occurred in the Etnean area during 1978-1987 have been used to reveal the possible anomalies in the propagation of seismic waves in the shallowest part of the volcanic edifice. A set of 134 shocks located in different sectors of the volcano and having a depth not exceeding 5-8 km was used. The availability of instrumental records and accurate macroseismic information made it possible to compare the epicentres derived from these two data sets. Time residuals, obtained after fixing the macroseismic epicentre as the reference one, were mapped for each permanent station of the local seismic network. Maps of residuals pointed out the existence of wide anomalies in the eastern sector of the volcano at a depth not greater than 4-5 km. These anomalies strongly influence the seismic wave propagation, so that the shallow part of the crustal model generally adopted should take them into account. Moreover, a very shallow anomaly was detected in the upper parts of the southern sector of the volcano. Although based on a qualitative approach, such findings strongly support the hypothesis that shallow volcanic structures and heterogeneity significantly influence the seismic energy propagation and they can be used to improve a three-dimensional velocity model for the Etnean area.

abstract = {Our present understanding of the mantle carbon budget is in part built upon measurements of carbon concentrations in olivine hosted melt inclusions. Only a small number of such datasets are thought to have avoided degassing, having been entrapped prior to CO2vapour saturation, and are therefore able to constrain primary CO2concentrations. The absence of degassing in melt inclusion datasets has been inferred from the presence of strong correlations between CO2and trace elements. In this contribution, we demonstrate that partial degassing followed by magma mixing not only retains such positive correlations, but can enhance them. Simple models of magma mixing and degassing are used to characterise how CO2-trace element systematics respond to CO2vapour saturation in primary mantle melts entering the crust, followed by magma mixing. Positive correlations are expected between CO2and most trace elements, and the average CO2/Ba and CO2/Nb ratios are controlled by the pressure of magma storage, rather than the CO2concentration in the mantle. We find that the best estimates of mantle CO2are the maximum CO2/Ba ratios observed in melt inclusion datasets, though a large number of analyses are required to adequately characterise the maximum of the CO2/Ba distribution. Using the mixing and degassing models we estimate the number of analyses required to obtain a maximum CO2/Ba observation within 10{\%} of the mantle value. In light of our results, we reassess existing melt inclusion datasets, and find they exhibit systematics associated with partial degassing and mixing. We argue that all the data presently available is consistent with a depleted mantle CO2/Ba ratio of ∼140, and there is as yet no evidence for heterogeneity in the CO2/Ba ratio of the depleted mantle.},

abstract = {Elasticity theory predicts that a slit in homogeneous and isotropic material subjected to uniform internal pressure and uniform regional stresses will have a symmetric, elliptical form. The form in cross section of a dike from the Spanish Peaks, Colorado, and a sill from the Henry Mountains, Utah, is asymmetrical and similar to an elongate teardrop. The asymmetry of the dike and sill could be a function of gradients in the regional stress and magma pressure at the time of intrusion. An elasticity theory analysis for a slit subjected to linear gradients in regional stress and magma pressure predicts an asymmetrical teardrop form. The amount of asymmetry is controlled by the slit length, the difference between pressure and stress gradients (effective stress gradient), and the difference between the average pressure and regional stress (average driving pressure). A least squares regression curve for the theoretical form of the slit shows a good correlation with the measured form of the sheet intrusions. For the dike, a stress gradient sufficient to produce the asymmetrical form could have been generated by a ground surface slope of less than 5° or by bending the host rock into the La Veta syncline, which is cut by the dike. A pressure gradient of sufficient magnitude could have been generated in static magma with a strength of at least 104 dyn/cm2. Because the sill dilated in part by bending the relatively thin overburden, our model is inappropriate.},

We develop a technique for inverting geodetic, extrusive flux, and other types of data using a physics-based model of an effusive silicic volcanic eruption to estimate the geometry, pressure, depth, and volatile content of a magma chamber, and properties of the conduit linking the chamber to the surface. A Bayesian inverse formulation makes it possible to easily incorporate independent information into the inversion, such as petrologic estimates of melt water content, and yields probabilistic estimates for model parameters and other properties of the volcano. Probability distributions are sampled using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We apply the technique using GPS and extrusion data from the 2004–2008 eruption of Mount St. Helens. In contrast to more traditional inversions such as those involving geodetic data alone in combination with kinematic forward models, this technique is able to provide constraint on properties of the magma, including its volatile content, and on the absolute volume and pressure of the magma chamber. Results suggest a large chamber of {\textgreater}40 km3 with a centroid depth of 11–18 km and a dissolved water content at the top of the chamber of 2.6–4.9 wt{\%}.},

abstract = {Aeroacoustic jet noise theory describes the relationship between acoustic signals and jet operating parameters. Based on empirical aeroacoustic relationships, a link between peak frequency and amplitude and jet diameter and velocity has been used by volcano acousticians to return the operating parameters of column generating volcanic eruptions. There are however significant differences between the nozzle geometries and structures of flows studied in the aeroacoustic literature and flows emitted from volcanic vents. These differences raise questions as to the validity of applying engineering relationships to volcanic eruptions. Combining particle image velocimetry and acoustic data we investigated the flow structures, acoustic signals and dominant source locations of jet flows emitted from three simple nozzle geometries (convergent, straight and divergent). Flows from the straight and divergent nozzles exited in a more developed flow regime than those emitted from convergent nozzles. While for the convergent nozzles dominant sound sources were located within the jet flow, the dominant signals from the straight and divergent nozzles were located in the region of the nozzle exit. Consequently, for the straight and divergent nozzles it was not possible to differentiate between signals generated by the jet flow and those generated by internal sound sources without beamforming analysis. In order to better replicate the volcanic case and in contrast to studies for industrial applications, our experimental test section was not engineered to minimise internal noise. Without acoustic treatment such as screens, choke plates and paddles, jet noise signals were contaminated by signals generated within the test rig and so, even for the convergent nozzles, the aeroacoustic relationships derived from engineering studies could not be used to retrieve the jet operating parameters. Our results indicate that in the volcanic case, the raw acoustic spectra will contain signals generated by both in-conduit and above-vent processes. Therefore inversions for volcanic jet parameters such as mass eruption rate from standard aeroacoustic relationships may be unreliable.},

abstract = {Field explosion experiments using dynamite were carried out to investigate the effect of explosion energy and depth on the nature of explosion cloud. The scaling law of explosion was established among the energy, depth, and the nature of explosion cloud; shape, height and duration of flow out. The shape of explosion cloud changed systematically from funnel type via elongated to short types with increasing the scaled depth of explosion. At the shallow scaled depth, both scaled height and scaled duration increased with increasing scaled depth. Both values reached the maximum at 0.003-0.004 M/J(1/3) of cube-root scaled depth, and then decreased with increasing scaled depth. If the cube-root scaled depth was over about 0.01 m/J(t/3), we could not observe any explosion cloud on the ground surface. These experimental results should be applicable to the understanding of volcanic explosions if the buoyant effect of internal heat in the explosion cloud was negligible and ground medium is identical. We applied these results to the explosion clouds of Usu phreatic explosion at 14:53 h on 17 April 2000, and estimated that the explosion energy and the depth were 4 X 10(9) J and 6 in, respectively. Errors caused by uncertainty of scaling factors are less than one order of magnitude for the energy and depth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Eruptive activity at the Showa crater of the Sakurajima volcano has steadily increased since it resumed in June 2006, and 2718 vulcanian eruptions occurred during the period from 2008 to 2011. In this paper, we clarify the characteristics of vulcanian eruptions at the Showa crater based mainly on ground deformation. A long-term extension of the ground of the Aira caldera and Sakurajima, repeating quasi-annual cycles of minor inflation-deflation, were obtained by GPS, tilt and strain observations. The inflation event that started in October 2009 was the largest. Major pressure source was estimated to be located at a depth of 12 km beneath the Aira caldera for the inflation and a minor source was obtained a depth of 5 km at the northern flank of Kitadake in addition to a source beneath Minamidake which has been know by previous studies. The magma plumbing system is composed of a major magma reservoir at a depth of ≈ 10 km beneath the Aira caldera and additional magma reservoirs at depths of around 5 km beneath the summit area from the north flank of Kitadake to Minamidake. Strain changes which indicate inflation were detected prior to explosions and the inflation strain lasted mostly 1 h. The strain changes were caused by a shallow pressure source less than 1.5 km. The inflation occasionally continued for more than 7 h with an addition of inflation of a deep source (4 km), which corresponds to the magma reservoir beneath Minamidake. The conduit to the Showa crater may be branched from the magma reservoir beneath Minamidake or from the major conduit connected to it. When inflationary ground deformation progressed at a high rate, the eruptive activity reached a peak from December 2009 to March 2010. This suggests that the accumulation of magma beneath the central cones of the Sakurajima volcano progressed simultaneously to a discharge of magma. The simultaneous progress of the accumulation and discharge of magma and the frequent occurrence of small vulcanian eruptions may be related to the small open conduit.},

abstract = {Vulcanian-type eruptive activity has occurred from the summit crater of Sakurajima volcano, Japan, since 1955. Over this period, harmonic tremors have commonly occurred either several hours after swarms of B-type earthquakes (herein termed HTB: Harmonic Tremor following B-type earthquake swarm) or immediately after explosive eruptions (herein termed HTE: Harmonic Tremor after an Eruption). In this study, we analyzed the spectra and particle motions of HTBs and HTEs. Both HTBs and HTEs have spectra with peaks at fundamental frequencies and higher frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequencies. The peak frequencies of HTBs remained within a certain range, whereas those of HTEs showed a gradual increase. The spectra of an HTB that occurred on 20 July 1990 had stable fundamental frequencies of 1.46-1.66 Hz and at least 9 peaks of higher modes; in contrast, the HTE that occurred 3 minutes after an explosive eruption at 11 h 15 m (JST) on 11 October 2002 showed clear frequency gliding from 0.8 to 3.7 Hz in the fundamental mode. The peak frequencies of higher modes of the HTE also showed an increase corresponding to the shift of the fundamental mode towards a higher frequency. Particle motion analysis mainly identified Rayleigh waves from the prograde elliptical motion at the deepest borehole station (HAR) and retrograde motions at the other shallower stations. Love waves were dominant at the stations north and south of the crater. The distribution patterns of Rayleigh and Love waves of HTBs are similar to those of HTEs. The nature of the dominant surface waves of both HTBs and HTEs suggest that the sources of harmonic tremors are located at a shallow depth, corresponding to a gas pocket in the uppermost part of the volcanic conduit. Differences in the temporal characteristics of the HTB and HTE spectra reflect the internal condition of the gas pocket: HTBs are associated with inflation of the conduit, whereas HTEs occur following an eruption, associated with deflationary ground deformation. HTBs are caused by resonance of the gas pocket embedded beneath the lava dome. Although HTEs occur within the open conduit, the small size of vents enables resonance within the bubbly magma conduit. The positive gliding of dominant peaks toward higher frequencies is interpreted to result from shortening of the bubbly magma conduit due to a rise in the bubble nucleation level; this rise results from the re-pressurization that accompanies the ascent of magma from deep within the reservoir. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Microtextural characteristics of fresh ejecta from Stromboli volcano were examined from three periods of differing eruption style and intensity in 2002. Activity shifted from relatively weak and infrequent ash-charged explosions during January through May into two broad cycles of waxing activity in June through late September, and late September through December, followed by the onset on 28 December of the 2002/2003 effusive eruption. Analyzed sets of lapilli from May, September/October, and 28 December show contrasts in the physical properties of magma resident in the shallow conduit during this range of activity. Three distinct textures are observed among the analyzed pyroclasts: low density (LD) with an abundance of subspherical bubbles, the presence of large, irregularly shaped bubbles, and a light-to-transparent glass matrix; transitional texture (TT) with an intermediate number of subspherical bubbles, a high frequency of large, irregularly-shaped bubbles, and a honey colored glass matrix; and high density (HD) with sparse relatively small bubbles, conspicuous large irregular bubbles, and a dark glass matrix. Observational and quantitative data (density, vesicle size) indicate that these textures are linked through variable residence time in Stromboli's shallow conduit, with an ongoing evolution from LD to HD magma. Calculations suggest that residual LD magma will evolve to HD texture in a period of hours to days. Contrasting amounts of the LD, TT, and HD magmas are present in each sample, with the most TT in May, the most LD in September/October, and the most HD in December. This implies that the shallow magma had a different rheology at each collection period. The viscosity of LD and HD magmas are calculated to be in the range of 2,000 to 2,600 and 3,000 to 5,000 Pa s, respectively, which, with their changing proportions, must have implications for rates of bubble slug ascent and processes of fragmentation. This study suggests that an increasing maturity of magma in Stromboli's shallow conduit (with resultant increase in viscosity) feeds back to reduce the intensity of explosions, whereas a steady flux of LD magma favors more powerful explosions.},

abstract = {Silicic volcanic eruptions are typically accompanied by repetitive long-period (LP) seismicity that originates from a small region of the upper conduit. These signals have the capability to advance eruption prediction, since they commonly precede a change in the eruption vigour. Shear bands forming along the conduit wall, where the shear stresses are highest, have been linked to providing the seismic trigger. However, existing computational models are unable to generate shear bands at the depths where the LP signals originate using simple magma strength models. Presented here is a model in which the magma strength is determined from a constitutive relationship dependent upon crystallinity and pressure. This results in a depth-dependent magma strength, analogous to planetary lithospheres. Hence, in shallow highly crystalline regions a macroscopically discontinuous brittle type of deformation will prevail, whilst in deeper crystal-poor regions there will be a macroscopically continuous plastic deformation mechanism. This will result in a depth where the brittle-ductile transition occurs, and here shear bands disconnected from the free-surface may develop. We utilise the Finite Element Method and use axi-symmetric coordinates to model magma flow as a viscoplastic material, simulating quasi-static shear bands along the walls of a volcanic conduit. Model results constrained to the Soufri??re Hills Volcano, Montserrat, show the generation of two types of shear bands: upper-conduit shear bands that form between the free-surface to a few 100 m below it and discrete shear bands that form at the depths where LP seismicity is measured to occur corresponding to the brittle-ductile transition and the plastic shear region. It is beyond the limitation of the model to simulate a seismic event, although the modelled viscosity within the discrete shear bands suggests a failure and healing cycle time that supports the observed LP seismicity repeat times. However, due to the paucity of data and large parameter space available these results can only be considered to be qualitative rather than quantitative at this stage. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Mount Vesuvius is emplaced on a regional NE-SW-trending fault that accommodates the stretching of the lithosphere caused by a backward retreat of the Calabrian arc. The dynamics of the Calabrian arc controls the temporal occurrence of earthquakes in the Southern Apennines and in Sicily. By means of a detailed statistical approach, we identified a significant correlation between seismic events occurring in different subsets of this geodynamic domain: seismicity changes in the Southern Apennines follow those in the Calabrian arc after 18-21 years, while seismicity changes in Sicily follow those in the Calabrian arc after 8-10 years. The seismicity changes in these three areas appear also to have affected the eruptive activity of Vesuvius in the period 1631-1944. The major effusive-explosive eruptions of this period followed the seismicity changes in the Southern Apennines after 6-13 years and those in the Calabrian arc after 36-39 years. From a tectonic point of view, this indicates a direct link between the eruptive activity of Vesuvius and the dynamics of the Calabrian arc. The backward retreat of the arc produces strain pulses propagating to adjacent areas. From a volcanological point of view, we speculate that the arrival of an extension strain pulse in the area of Vesuvius may trigger the fast movement of magma-filled cracks that stay in unstable equilibrium in the roots of the volcano. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

Here we report the results of a series of high-temperature, high-pressure experiments at conditions relevant for volcanic conduits (250??MPa confining pressure and temperature between 500????C and 900????C) that were undertaken to investigate the rheology of magma with crystal fractions varying between 0.5 and 0.8 (50 to 80??wt.{\%}) at different strain-rate conditions. The experiments demonstrate that the presence of crystals increases the relative viscosity (ratio between the viscosity of the mixture and the viscosity of the melt phase) of magmas and additionally induces a decrease of the relative viscosity with increasing strain-rate (shear thinning, non-Newtonian behavior). The experimental results, combined with existing data at low crystal fractions (0-0.3), were used to develop a semi-empirical parameterization that describes the variations of relative viscosity for crystal fractions between 0 and 0.8 and accounts for the complex non-Newtonian rheology of crystal-bearing magmas. The new parameterization, included into numerical models simulating the magma ascent dynamics, reveals that strain-rate-dependent rheology significantly modifies the dynamic behavior inside volcanic conduits, particularly affecting the magma fragmentation conditions. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Eruption mass and mass flow rate are critical parameters for determining the aerial extent and hazard of volcanic emissions. Infrasound waveform inversion is a promising technique to quantify volcanic emissions. Although topography may substantially alter the infrasound waveform as it propagates, advances in wave propagation modeling and station coverage permit robust inversion of infrasound data from volcanic explosions. The inversion can estimate eruption mass flow rate and total eruption mass if the flow density is known. However, infrasound-based eruption flow rates and mass estimates have yet to be validated against independent measurements, and numerical modeling has only recently been applied to the inversion technique. Here we present a robust full-waveform acoustic inversion method, and use it to calculate eruption flow rates and masses from 49 explosions from Sakurajima Volcano, Japan. Six infrasound stations deployed from 12–20 February 2015 recorded the explosions. We compute numerical Green's functions using 3-D Finite Difference Time Domain modeling and a high-resolution digital elevation model. The inversion, assuming a simple acoustic monopole source, provides realistic eruption masses and excellent fit to the data for the majority of the explosions. The inversion results are compared to independent eruption masses derived from ground-based ash collection and volcanic gas measurements. Assuming realistic flow densities, our infrasound-derived eruption masses for ash-rich eruptions compare favorably to the ground-based estimates, with agreement ranging from within a factor of two to one order of magnitude. Uncertainties in the time-dependent flow density and acoustic propagation likely contribute to the mismatch between the methods. Our results suggest that realistic and accurate infrasound-based eruption mass and mass flow rate estimates can be computed using the method employed here. If accurate volcanic flow parameters are known, application of this technique could be broadly applied to enable near real-time calculation of eruption mass flow rates and total masses. These critical input parameters for volcanic eruption modeling and monitoring are not currently available.},

abstract = {Explosive sources triggered inside a magma conduit may excite the conduit into acoustic resonance. The acoustic field in the conduit can propagate into the atmosphere through an open vent and ensonify the overlying atmosphere. The character of the airborne sound field is determined by a combination of propagation and source effects: the resonance of the magmatic conduit and the diffraction of the sound field at the volcanic vent are acoustic propagation effects, whereas the explosion pressure signature and the firing rate of the explosions define the source characteristics. For wavelengths larger than the conduit radius, only the longitudinal resonances of the magmatic conduit are relevant, and the open vent radiates like a piston surrounded by an infinite baffle. In this case, the fluid particle velocities are directed along the axis of the conduit and the sound field may propagate into the surrounding bedrock through the conduit wall displacement induced by the fluid overpressure. This coupling may produce seismic signals with banded spectra, such as volcanic tremor and long-period events. The airborne pressure field retains the modal structure of the sound field in the magmatic conduit, which contains information on the conduit geometry and geo-acoustic properties of the magma. The seismic wavefield is driven by the acoustic field in the magma and also contains this information, although it may be filtered by propagation effects in the bedrock. The theoretical sound field in the magma conduit is used to interpret seismic tremor signals recorded at Mt. Spurr Volcano, Alaska. Rapid variations in the acoustic impedance of the magma conduit terminations can create systematic changes in the tremor spectra, which can be used to monitor changes in the magmatic system. The results of the modelling illustrate the difference between source effects and conduit resonance, as well as the value of seismoacoustic measurements in volcanic environments.},

abstract = {It has long been assumed that seismogenic faulting is confined to cool, brittle rocks, with a temperature upper limit of approximately 600 degrees C (ref. 1). This thinking underpins our understanding of volcanic earthquakes, which are assumed to occur in cold rocks surrounding moving magma. However, the recent discovery of abundant brittle-ductile fault textures in silicic lavas has led to the counter-intuitive hypothesis that seismic events may be triggered by fracture and faulting within the erupting magma itself. This hypothesis is supported by recent observations of growing lava domes, where microearthquake swarms have coincided with the emplacement of gouge-covered lava spines, leading to models of seismogenic stick-slip along shallow shear zones in the magma. But can fracturing or faulting in high-temperature, eruptible magma really generate measurable seismic events? Here we deform high-temperature silica-rich magmas under simulated volcanic conditions in order to test the hypothesis that high-temperature magma fracture is seismogenic. The acoustic emissions recorded during experiments show that seismogenic rupture may occur in both crystal-rich and crystal-free silicic magmas at eruptive temperatures, extending the range of known conditions for seismogenic faulting.},

abstract = {During volcanic eruptions, volcanic ash transport and dispersion models (VATDs) are used to forecast the location and movement of ash clouds over hours to days in order to define hazards to aircraft and to communities downwind. Those models use input parameters, called "eruption source parameters", such as plume height H, mass eruption rate Ṁ, duration D, and the mass fraction m63 of erupted debris finer than about 4$\phi${\{}symbol{\}} or 63 $\mu$m, which can remain in the cloud for many hours or days. Observational constraints on the value of such parameters are frequently unavailable in the first minutes or hours after an eruption is detected. Moreover, observed plume height may change during an eruption, requiring rapid assignment of new parameters. This paper reports on a group effort to improve the accuracy of source parameters used by VATDs in the early hours of an eruption. We do so by first compiling a list of eruptions for which these parameters are well constrained, and then using these data to review and update previously studied parameter relationships. We find that the existing scatter in plots of H versus Ṁ yields an uncertainty within the 50{\%} confidence interval of plus or minus a factor of four in eruption rate for a given plume height. This scatter is not clearly attributable to biases in measurement techniques or to well-recognized processes such as elutriation from pyroclastic flows. Sparse data on total grain-size distribution suggest that the mass fraction of fine debris m63 could vary by nearly two orders of magnitude between small basaltic eruptions (∼ 0.01) and large silicic ones ({\textgreater} 0.5). We classify eleven eruption types; four types each for different sizes of silicic and mafic eruptions; submarine eruptions; "brief" or Vulcanian eruptions; and eruptions that generate co-ignimbrite or co-pyroclastic flow plumes. For each eruption type we assign source parameters. We then assign a characteristic eruption type to each of the world's ∼ 1500 Holocene volcanoes. These eruption types and associated parameters can be used for ash-cloud modeling in the event of an eruption, when no observational constraints on these parameters are available.},

abstract = {? 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.We conduct experiments to investigate the sintering of high-viscosity liquid droplets. Free-standing cylinders of spherical glass beads are heated above their glass transition temperature, causing them to densify under surface tension. We determine the evolving volume of the bead pack at high spatial and temporal resolution. We use these data to test a range of existing models. We extend the models to account for the time-dependent droplet viscosity that results from non-isothermal conditions, and to account for non-zero final porosity. We also present a method to account for the initial distribution of radii of the pores interstitial to the liquid spheres, which allows the models to be used with no fitting parameters. We find a good agreement between the models and the data for times less than the capillary relaxation timescale. For longer times, we find an increasing discrepancy between the data and the model as the Darcy outgassing time-scale approaches the sintering timescale. We conclude that the decreasing permeability of the sintering system inhibits latestage densification. Finally, we determine the residual, trapped gas volume fraction at equilibrium using Xray computed tomography and compare this with theoretical values for the critical gas volume fraction in systems of overlapping spheres.},

abstract = {Evidence of subharmonic period-doubling cascades has recently been recognized in seismograms of volcanic tremor from several volcanoes. This phenomenon occurs only in nonlinear systems, and is the commonest route by which such systems change from periodic to chaotic behavior. It is predicted to occur in a model of volcanic tremor excitation by flow-induced vibration, and it might well also occur in other volcano-seismic source process. If the possibility of period doubling is not taken into account in interpreting spectra of tremor and long-period earthquakes, then low-frequency 'sub-harmonic' oscillations may be mis-identified as normal modes of a linear acoustic resonator, leading to errors of an order of magnitude or more in inferred magma-body dimensions. This example illustrates the importance of nonlinear phenomena in attempts to understand volcano-seismic phenomena physically. Linear systems are fundamentally incapable of causing earthquakes or exciting tremor, so nonlinearity is essential to any theory of volcano-seismic phenomena. Nonlinear processes are in many respects qualitatively different from linear ones. A few of their characteristics that might be relevant in volcanoes include the possibility: (1) that damping might increase, rather than decrease, oscillation frequencies; and (2) that these frequencies might be functions of the amplitude of oscillation, so that temporal variations in spectral peak frequencies might not be manifestations of changes of conditions within the magmatic system.

abstract = {The wave fields generated by Strombolian activity are investigated using data from small-aperture seismic arrays deployed on the north flank of Stromboli and data from seismic and pressure transducers set up near the summit crater. Measurements of slowness and azimuth as a function of time clearly indicate that the sources of tremor and explosions are located beneath the summit crater at depths shallower than 200 m with occasional bursts of energy originating from sources extending to a depth of 3 km. Slowness, azimuth, and particle motion measurements reveal a complex composition of body and surface waves associated with topography, structure, and source properties. Body waves originating at depths shallower than 200 m dominate the wave field at frequencies of 0.5–2.5 Hz, and surface waves generated by the surficial part of the source and by scattering sources distributed around the island dominate at frequencies above 2.5 Hz. The records of tremor and explosions are both dominated by SH motion. Far-field records from explosions start with radial motion, and near-field records from those events show dominantly horizontal motion and often start with a low-frequency (1–2 Hz) precursor characterized by elliptical particle motion, followed within a few seconds by a high-frequency radial phase (1–10 Hz) accompanying the eruption of pyroclastics. The dominant component of the near- and far-field particle motions from explosions, and the timing of air and body wave phases observed in the near field, are consistent with a gas-piston mechanism operating on a shallow ({\textless}200 m deep), vertical crack-like conduit. Models of a degassing fluid column suggest that noise emissions originating in the collective oscillations of bubbles ascending in the magma conduit may provide an adequate self-excitation mechanism for sustained tremor generation at Stromboli.},

abstract = {Volcanic tremor at Stromboli (Aeolian islands, Italy) is correlated to small infrasonic transients [Ripepe et al., 1996] which repeat almost rythmically in time in a range between 0.8 and 1.2 s. We demonstrate that infrasonic transients are associated to small gas bubble (similar to 0.5 m) burstings which produces no transients in the seismic signal. Tremor ground displacement attenuates with the inverse of the distance from the craters indicating that the source is shallow. Short-term energy release shows that infrasonic and seismic signals are linked to the same dynamical process, while at the long-term scale it is evident that the two signals are controlled by two distinctive mechanisms. We suggest that the possible physical model acts in two steps: first, gas coalescence and, then, gas bursting. In our model, the seismic signal is related to the coalescence of a gas bubble from a layer of small bubbles, while the infrasonic signal is linked to the bursting of the bubble when it reaches the magma surface. Gas bubbles could form by free coalescence in magma or could be forced to coalesce by a structural barrier. We calculate that forced coalescence induces in magma a pressure change (similar to 10(4) Pa) 2 orders of magnitude higher than free coalescence, and it explains best the tremor ground displacement (10(-5) m) recorded at Stromboli. Moreover, forced coalescence evidences the role of a structural barrier, such as a dike, in volcanic tremor source dynamics. In this gas dynamic; process, the delay time of 1-2 s between infrasonic pulses could reflect the gas nucleation interval of basaltic magma [Thomas et al., 1993; Manga, 1996]. We propose that the source function for the shallow volcanic tremor at Stromboli could be the viscoelastic reaction of the magma to the pressure decrease induced by gas bubble growth rate under constant depressurization. The spectrum of our source function is controlled by the time duration of the pressure pulse, which represents the viscoelastic relaxation time of the magma and gas bubble growth rate. The predicted asymptotic decay of the frequency contents fits the spectral behavior of the vocanic tremor ground displacement recorded at Stromboli. We show that the same spectral behavior can be found in ground displacement spectra of volcanic tremor recorded on different volcanoes.},

abstract = {The relative elastic energy partitioning during Strombolian eruptions can be estimated from acoustic pressure and seismic velocity records. We outline methods for determining acoustic and seismic energies for sensors deployed within several kilometers of erupting vents. We use these energies to introduce the concept of the volcano acoustic-seismic ratio (??, or VASR), which is the ratio of elastic energy propagated through the atmosphere and into the earth. Eruption VASR is a physical diagnostic of explosive degassing that is appropriate for comparing eruption mechanisms at individual and between various volcanoes. Here we assess acoustic and seismic energies and corresponding VASR for discrete Strombolian explosive events at Karymsky and Erebus Volcanoes. We attribute the relatively high and stable VASR at Erebus (?? = 8, standard deviation 41{\%}) to repeatable source conditions occurring at the surface of a persistent lava lake, with accompanying strong coupling to the atmosphere. Lower and more variable VASR at Karymsky (?? = 0.18 in 1998 to ?? = 1.51 in 1991, with standard deviations of 93{\%} and 313{\%}, respectively) is attributed to changing conditions within a narrow, partially choked conduit. Variable seismo-acoustic energy partitioning for Karymsky, as manifested by the large VASR standard deviation, suggests that conduit conditions affecting VASR, which include magma properties, conduit obstruction, or fragmentation depths can evolve both during the course of an explosion and between successive events. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Volcanic processes occur in a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. However, a key step of magma ascent is recognizable in the dynamics of gas and magma in the shallow plumbing system, where volatiles play a fundamental role in controlling the eruptive style. With the aim of investigating shallow degassing processes, an experimental setup was deployed at Mt. Yasur, an active volcano located in Tanna Island (Vanuatu arc), from 9th to 12th July 2011. The setup comprised high-speed and thermal cameras, as well as a microphone, capable of recording both in the infrasonic and audible range. The analysis of acoustic signals, validated by observing images from the high-speed and thermal cameras, has enabled characterizing the explosive activity during the investigated period. Two types of explosions, distinct for spectral features and waveforms, were observed: (i) minor events, corresponding to small overpressurized bursts, occurring almost continuously; (ii) major events, characterizing the Strombolian activity at Mt. Yasur. By investigating variation in the occurrence rate of the minor events, we found that, on a short timescale, the dynamics responsible for the two types of explosions are decoupled. These results, together with previous literature data, bring additional evidence of the existence of distinct sources of degassing. Finally, major events can be distinguished as emergent events, i.e. long-lasting signals, corresponding to ash-rich explosions, and impulsive events, featuring shorter duration and larger amplitude.},

abstract = {Volcanic rock samples were systematically collected during the 2006 eruptive episodes at Mt. Etna. Major and trace elements, together with Sr-Pb isotope ratios, were then obtained on the whole rocks, for different times of emission and vent locations. On the same samples, selected plagioclase crystals were investigated through high-contrast BSE images and core-to-rim compositional profiles for An{\%} and FeO wt.{\%} were obtained. The major element variation through time suggests the involvement of a more basic magma, because MgO/FeO tot and CaO/Al 2O 3 ratios tend to increase from the beginning to the end of the eruption. This more basic magma was characterized by a peculiar geochemical and isotopic signature. This is testified by the negative trend of LREEs, some HFSEs (e.g., Nb, Zr, Y) and lead isotopes, together with increase of some incompatible element ratios (e.g., Rb/La, Zr/Nb) with respect to products erupted before. Concerning the plagioclase crystals, four main texture types were recognized at the core and rim, which indicate either near-equilibrium crystallization or disequilibrium accompanied by strong destabilization. These textures were attributed to: i) crystallization at equilibrium conditions at depth or within the open-conduit (two types of oscillatory zoning), ii) magma decompression at variable ascent rates (coarsely sieve-textures and dissolution at the core), iii) inputs of more basic magma (sieve-textured rims). All the available data, coupled with CO 2/SO 2 molar ratio measured in the gas plume obtained from literature, support the idea that the pulsating regime observed for the volcanic phenomena at the surface during the period July-December 2006 reflects the transient, rapid ascent of several CO 2 bubble fluxes and/or CO 2-rich magma batches from the deep to the shallow levels of the plumbing system. This integrated study has also led to the identification of the replenishment event during the eruption that allowed the ingress of the magma with distinct geochemical/isotopic signature. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Volcanic events comprising multiple eruptive stages are common in the historical and geological record and display activity of variable intensity ranging, in some cases, through to several centuries. To better understand the characteristics of such events globally, this study explores a database of historical events having Volcanic Explosivity Indices 4 or greater. The database was compiled for the most part from published and unpublished material provided by the Smithsonian Institution. The database was examined to find common statistical relationships, within and between the variables characterising multi-stage explosive events. In concert with common usage, an event is defined here as clearly related activity over days to years whereas a stage represents a shorter duration (hours to weeks) characterised by one distinct style of activity. Over half of all volcanic events investigated exhibited more than one explosive stage and 77{\%} of these stages occurred within the first 10{\%} of the total defined duration of the event. This investigation confirmed a general eruptive pattern of declining explosivity with time and reaffirmed a positive correlation between stage column height and volume. Distributions presented in this paper are a first step towards describing the general patterns displayed by multi-stage events; however, it must be cautioned that they may be applicable neither for any particular volcanic centre nor across all eruptive scales and styles.},

abstract = {In this work we propose an effective viscosity criterion for the stabilization of annular gas-liquid and liquid-particle flows and an inertial mechanism which drives waves into slugs in slugging gas-liquid flows. Annular flow is stable when the fluid having the higher effective viscosity occupies the core region and the lower viscosity fluid is in the annulus. The eddy viscosity criterion is shown to be very consistent with published work on annular flow transitions in horizontal and vertical gas-liquid flows. It also applies to a variety of liquid-solid and gas-solid flows. In the second part of the paper we propose a mechanism for explaining the growth of initially small waves and initiation of slugs in gas-liquid flow.

abstract = {At many volcanoes, low magma-viscosities allow persistent degassing over a range of styles from explosive Strombolian activity to gas 'puffing' and passive degassing. It is generally accepted that Strombolian eruptions reflect the bursting of large bubbles (gas slugs) at the magma surface and that relatively quiescent 'puffing' indicates the presence of significantly smaller bubbles or slugs. Here, we address this qualitative range and derive a dimensionless parameter, Pslim
*, to quantify and distinguish different regimes of 'burst vigour'. For Pslim
* ??? 1, 'passive' activity is anticipated and measurable parameters such as infrasonic amplitude will be small. For Pslim
* {\textgreater} 1, bursting slugs will be energetic, and surface effects are anticipated to increase with increasing Pslim
*. Various physical parameters recorded during laboratory experiments and simulated through numerical models are shown to demonstrate the same trends when parameterised by Pslim
*. Hence, Pslim
* provides a straightforward relationship between changes in measurable surface effects and the system's subsurface physical parameters and, for energetic activity of a particular system, burst effects are shown to be proportional to the square root of the gas mass involved. Effect magnitudes are also shown to be a function of atmospheric pressure and application of Pslim

abstract = {The canonical Strombolian paradigm of a gas slug ascending and bursting in a homogeneous low-viscosity magma cannot explain the complex details in eruptive dynamics recently revealed by field measurements and textural and geochemical analyses. Evidence points to the existence of high-viscosity magma at the top of the conduit of Strombolian-type volcanoes, acting as a plug. Here, new experiments detail the range of flow configurations that develop during the ascent and burst of a slug through rheologically stratified magma within a conduit. End-member scenarios of a tube fully filled with either high- or low-viscosity liquid bracket three main flow configurations: (1) a plug sufficiently large to fully accommodate an ascending gas slug; (2) A plug that can accommodate the intrusion of low-viscosity liquid driven by the gas expansion, but not all the slug volume, so the slug bursts with the nose in the plug whilst the base is still in the low-viscosity liquid; (3) Gas expansion is sufficient to drive the intrusion of low-viscosity liquid through the plug, with the slug bursting in the low-viscosity layer emplaced dynamically above the plug. We show that the same flow configurations are viable at volcanic-scale through a new experimentally-validated 1D model and 3D computational fluid dynamic simulations. Applied to Stromboli, our results demonstrate that the key parameters controlling the transition between each configuration are gas volume, plug thickness and plug viscosity. The flow processes identified include effective dynamic narrowing and widening of the conduit, instabilities within the falling magma film, transient partial and complete blockage of the conduit, and slug disruption. These complexities influence eruption dynamics and vigour, promoting magma mingling and resulting in pulsatory release of gas.},

abstract = {We use a strike-slip fault analog model to study experimentally the role played by along-fault non-uniform and asymmetric applied normal stress on both coseismic slip and long-term fault behavior. Our model is based on a visco-elasto-plastic multi-layered rheology that allows to produce several hundreds of scaled analog microquakes and associated seismic cycles. Uniform or heterogeneous applied normal stress along the fault plane is imposed and maintained constant during the whole experiment durations. Our results suggest that coseismic slip patterns are strongly controlled by spatial normal stress variations and subsequent accumulated shear stress along fault strike. Major microquakes occur preferentially in zones of major shear stress asperities. Coseismic slip distributions exhibit a pattern similar to the along-fault applied normal stress distribution. The occurrence of isolated low to moderate microquakes where residual stresses persist around secondary stress asperities, indicates that stress conditions along the fault also control the whole variability of fault slip events. Moreover, when fault slip stability conditions are modulated by normal stress distribution, our experiments suggest that the along-fault stress heterogeneity influences the seismic cycle regularity and, consequently, long-term fault slip behavior. Uniform applied normal stress favors irregular seismic cycles and the occurrence of earthquakes clustering, whereas non-uniform normal stress with a single high amplitude stress asperity generates strong characteristic microquake events with stable return periods. Together our results strengthen the assumption that coseismic slip distribution and earthquake variability along an active fault may provide relevant information on long term tectonic stress and could thus improve seismic hazard assessment.},

abstract = {Lava dome eruptions commonly display fairly regular alternations between periods of high activity and periods of low or no activity. The time scale for these alternations is typically months to several years. Here we develop a generic model of magma discharge through a conduit from an open-system magma chamber with continuous replenishment. The model takes account of the principal controls on flow, namely the replenishment rate, magma chamber size, elastic deformation of the chamber walls, conduit resistance, and variations of magma viscosity, which are controlled by degassing during ascent and kinetics of crystallization. The analysis indicates a rich diversity of behavior with periodic patterns similar to those observed. Magma chamber size can be estimated from the period with longer periods implying larger chambers. Many features observed in volcanic eruptions such as alternations between periodic behaviors and continuous discharge, sharp changes in discharge rate, and transitions from effusive to catastrophic explosive eruption can be understood in terms of the non-linear dynamics of conduit flows from open-system magma chambers. The dynamics of lava dome growth at Mount St. Helens (1980-1987) and Santiaguito (1922-2000) was analyzed with the help of the model. The best-fit models give magma chamber volumes of ???0.6 km3 for Mount St. Helens and ???65 km3 for Santiaguito. The larger magma chamber volume is the major factor in explaining why Santiaguito is a long-lived eruption with a longer periodicity of pulsations in comparison with Mount St. Helens. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {We discuss the process of vulcanian eruptions on the basis of temporal variation of the texture of andesitic volcanic ash ejected from the Sakurajima volcano, Japan. Falling ash samples were collected every 2-50. min for petrological analysis. These ash samples contained juvenile particles, altered rock fragments, and fragments of crystals; here, we subdivide the juvenile particles into blocky, vesicular, and fluidal particles. Because the crystallinities of the vesicular and fluidal particles are lower than those of the blocky particles, we refer to the vesicular and fluidal particles as low-crystallinity particles (LCPs) and the blocky particles as high-crystallinity particles (HCPs). The temporal variation observed in ash texture reveals that the ratio of LCPs to HCPs (LCP/HCP) was small at the initiation of the eruption and increased as the eruption progressed. The higher microlite crystallinity in the HCPs indicates crystallization under lower pressures for longer durations relative to the LCP magma. The increase of the LCP/HCP ratio during a single vulcanian eruption suggests that the emission of less viscous gas-rich magma under a cap rock increases as the eruption progresses. Such temporal variation in ash texture reflects the transition from a sudden explosion to continuous ash emission during a vulcanian eruption. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This result suggests that the short duration of the vulcanian explosion is controlled by the rapid decrease of the magma ascent rate to a vent.

abstract = {The 1999 basaltic eruption of Shishaldin volcano ( Alaska, USA) included both Strombolian and Subplinian activity, as well as a "pre-Subplinian" phase interpreted as the local coalescence within a long foam in the conduit. Although few visual observations were made of the eruption, a great deal of information regarding gas velocity, gas flux at the vent and plume height may be inferred by using acoustic recordings of the eruption. By relating acoustic power to gas velocity, a time series of gas velocity is calculated for the Subplinian and pre-Subplinian phases. These time series show trends in gas velocity that are interpreted as plumes or, for those signals lasting only a short time, thermals. The Subplinian phase is shown to be composed of a thermal followed by five plumes with a total expelled gas volume of approximate to 1.5 x 10(7) m(3). The initiation of the Subplinian activity is probably related to the arrival of a large overpressurised bubble close to the top of the magma column. A gradual increase in low-frequency (0.01-0.5 Hz) signal prior to this "trigger bubble" may be due to the rise of the bubble in the conduit. This delay corresponds to a reservoir located at approximate to 3.9 km below the surface, in good agreement with studies on other volcanoes. The presence of two thermal phases is also identified in the middle of the pre-Subplinian phase with a total gas release of approximate to 4.3 x 10(6) m(3) and approximate to 3.6 x 10(6) m(3). Gas velocity at the vent is found to be approximate to 82 m.s(-1) and approximate to 90 m.s(-1) for the Subplinian plumes and the pre-Subplinian thermals respectively. The agreement is very good between estimates of the gas flux from modelling the plume height and those obtained from acoustic measurements, leading to a new method by which eruption physical parameters may be quantified. Furthermore, direct measurements of gas velocity can be used for better estimates of the SO2 flux released during the eruption.},

abstract = {Certain polymers exhibit two distinct branches in their capillary flow curves (wall shear stress versus apparent wall shear rate). This gives rise to oscillatory flow in constant‐piston‐speed rheometers and to flow curve hysteresis in controlled‐pressure rheometers. These curious phenomena have attracted considerable interest over a period of many years, but their basic mechanisms are still the subject of debate. Building on previous work we have developed a model that predicts all the essential features of the curves of pressure and flow rate versus time in the oscillatory flow regime. Fluid compressibility and the second branch of the flow curve are necessary features of the model, but fluid elasticity is found not to be an essential element. While our macroscopic measurements do not prove it conclusively, our data lead us to believe that on the high‐flow‐rate branch of the flow curve there is slip along a cylindrical fracture surface near the wall. The jump to the high‐flow branch occurs when this fracture occurs, at an upper critical value of the shear stress, while the jump back to the low‐flow branch occurs when adhesion is established at the fracture surface at a lower critical shear stress.},

abstract = {Broadband seismic recordings in the near-field of Strombolian explosions, at 500 m distance, show pronounced effects of tilt. The tilt signal is predominant in the horizontal components beyond about 50 s period while it is negligible in the vertical component. The waveform of the tilt signal at the seismometer output is a double time integral of the waveform due to ground displacement. Since the waveform of the displacement is known from the vertical component, the waveform of the tilt signal in the horizontal seismogram can be reconstructed and both contributions can be separated from each other with a linear regression. We have analyzed data recorded in the summit region of Stromboli in 1995 and 1996. The regional tilt can be determined from the differential vertical displacement between instruments a few tens of meters apart. Local tilts determined with individual instruments scatter around the regional value, most probably due to local strain-tilt-coupling. Mogi's (1958) formulae for a pressure source in a homogeneous halfspace are used to interpret the results. The source displaces a volume of several tens of cubic meters of the surrounding rock before the explosive discharge; typical volumes were 25 m3 in July 1995 and 60 m3 in September 1996.},

abstract = {Active volcanoes are revealed to be dynamically evolving structures, the growth and development of which are characteristically punctuated by episodes of instability and subsequent structural failure. Edifice instability typically occurs in response to one or more of a range of agencies, including magma emplacement, the overloading or oversteepening of slopes, and peripheral erosion. Similarly, structural failure of a destabilized volcano may occur in response to a number of triggers of which seismogenic (e.g. tectonic or volcanic earthquakes) or magmagenic (e.g. pore-pressure changes due to magma intrusion) are common. Edifice failure and consequent debris avalanche formation appears to occur, on average, at least four times a century, and similar behaviour is now known to have occurred at volcanoes on Mars and Venus. Realization of the potential scale of structural failures and associated eruptive activity has major implications for the development of monitoring and hazard mitigation strategies at susceptible volcanoes, which must now address the possibility of future collapse events which may be ten times greater than that which occurred at Mount St Helens in 1980.},

abstract = {We present an acoustic waveform inversion technique for infrasound data to estimate volume fluxes from volcanic eruptions. Previous inversion techniques have been limited by the use of a 1-D Green's function in a free space or half space, which depends only on the source-receiver distance and neglects volcanic topography. Our method exploits full 3-D Green's functions computed by a numerical method that takes into account realistic topographic scattering.We apply this method to vulcanian eruptions at Sakurajima Volcano, Japan. Our inversion results produce excellent waveform fits to field observations and demonstrate that full 3-D Green's functions are necessary for accurate volume flux inversion. Conventional inversions without consideration of topographic propagation effects may lead to large errors in the source parameter estimate. The presented inversion technique will substantially improve the accuracy of eruption source parameter estimation (cf. mass eruption rate) during volcanic eruptions and provide critical constraints for volcanic eruption dynamics and ash dispersal forecasting for aviation safety. Application of this approach to chemical and nuclear explosions will also provide valuable source information (e.g., the amount of energy released) previously unavailable.},

Little is known of their behaviour as gas bubbles up through them in vertical columns. Using advanced tomographic instrumentation, the characteristics of these flows have been quantified. It was found that: the gas mainly travels as very large bubbles which occupy a significant part of the column cross-section and that very small bubbles (∼100$\mu$m) are created and trapped within the liquid. There is a periodic rising and falling of the top surface of the gas/liquid column as the large bubbles rise to the top and burst.},

The finite difference modeling assumed a gaussian source time function and an axisymmetric geometry. A clear demonstration of the significant distortion of infrasonic wavefronts was caused by diffraction at the vent rim edge. Data collected at Karymsky in 1997 and 1998 were compared to synthetic waveforms and variations of vent geometry were determined via grid search. Karymsky exhibited a wide range of variation in infrasonic waveforms, well explained by the diffraction, and modeled as changing vent geometry. Rim diffraction of volcanic infrasound is shown to be significant and must be accounted for when interpreting source physics from acoustic observations.},

@article{Scandone2007,
abstract = {We propose a new way of looking at the sequence of events leading to different styles of silicic, volcanic eruptions. Small-to-medium sized eruptions, either explosive or effusive, are explained by the ascent of isolated magma batches from mid-crustal magma chambers. We separate magma ascent into four different zones: the Supply System, the Intermediate Storage System, the Transport System and the Eruptive System. Of primary importance is the concept that ascent from the Intermediate Storage System through the Transport System to the Eruptive System first requires the development of a fracture network. Initially, this fracture network allows the ascent of individual magma batches by opening and then closing after their passage. An increase in the complexity of the fracture network with time increases the connectivity of the fractures and hence the ease of upward magma movement. In this model, the dynamics of the ensuing eruptions are controlled entirely by the time spent in the Transport System. Large explosive eruptions require a full interconnectivity of the Transport System from the Intermediate Storage System to the Eruptive System. Moreover, we suggest that a fully connected conduit is rare, develops only under particular conditions, and typically generates catastrophic eruptions during formation. Here we examine two case histories that illustrate the interplay of these processes: Mt St. Helens, USA, between 1980 and 2004, and Mt. Pinatubo, Philippines, in 1991. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Piton de La Fournaise is in a period of intense volcanic activity since 1998. To constrain the magma dynamics responsible for this activity, we combined GPS ground deformation monitoring interpreted through numerical modelling and geochemistry. Two cycles of continuous volcano inflation are evidenced for the May 2004-December 2005 period, with a rest from March to October 2005. These inflations are consistent with two cycles of compatible major element enrichment in the emitted lavas. Numerical models indicate that the pressurization of a single magma reservoir may be responsible for the observed pre-eruptive inflations of the volcano. The reservoir, located at 2300 m depth, has a radius of ∼ 500 m. At the beginning of each cycle, dykes propagate from the roof of the reservoir and yield eruptions of differentiated basalt near the summit. At the end of the cycle, dykes propagate from the eastern sidewall of the reservoir and yield distal eruptions of primitive magmas away from the summit. The volumes of magma emitted during the primitive eruptions seem too large to explain the surface deformations and therefore suggest some refill of the reservoir by deeper magmas. Our results may be used to predict the location and lava volume of future eruptions at Piton de La Fournaise volcano, depending on the timing of these eruptions within a cycle of volcanic activity. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Marsh1998,
abstract = {The observation that basic igneous rocks most commonly are holocrystalline under a wide spectrum of cooling regimes implies that cooling and crystallization can be uncoupled and considered separately. This is tantamount to realizing that the Avrami number is large in most igneous systems. Crystallization automatically adjusts through nucleation and growth to the cooling regime, and all aspects of the ensuing crystal population reflect the relative roles of nucleation and growth, which reflect the cooling regime. The characteristic scales of crystal size, crystal number, and crystallization time are intimately tied to the characteristic rates of nucleation and growth, but it is the crystal size distributions (CSDs) that provide fundamental insight on the time variations of nucleation and growth and also on the dynamics of magmatic systems. Crystal size distributions for batch systems are calculated by employing the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation for crystallinity related to exponential variations in time of both nucleation and growth. The slope of the CSD is set by the difference a - b, where a and b are exponential constants describing, respectively, nucleation and growth. The batch CSD has constant slope and systematically migrates to larger crystal size (L) with increasing crystallinity. The diminution in nucleation with loss of melt is reflected in the CSD at late times by a strong decrease in population density at small crystal sizes, which is rarely seen in igneous rocks themselves. Observed CSDs suggest thai a - b ∼6-10 and that b ∼0. That is, growth rate is approximately constant and nucleation rate apparently increases exponentially with time. Correlations among CSD slope, intercept, and maximum crystal size for both batch and open systems suggest that certain diagnostic relations may be useful in interpreting the CSD of comagmatic sequences. These systematics are explored heuristically and through the detailed examination of comagmatic CSDs in a number of igneous and industrial systems including, amongst others, Makaopuhi lava lake, Atka volcanic center, Peneplain sill, Dome Mountain lavas, Shonkin Sag laccolith, and Kilauea Iki lava lake. None of these systems shows CSDs typical of purely batch or purely open systems, even when the system itself is known on independent grounds to be a batch system. Instead, the CSDs of each system reflect a combination of kinetic and dynamic influences on crystallization. Heterogeneous nucleation and annexation of small crystals by larger ones, entrainment of earlier grown and ripened crystals, rate of solidification front advance, and protracted transit of a well-established mush column are some of the effects revealed in the observed CSDs. There may be an overall CSD evolution, reflecting the maturity of the magmatic system, from simple straight nonkinked CSDs in monogenetic systems to multiply kinked, piecewise continuous CSDs in well-established systems such as Hawaii and Mount Etna. This is not unlike the evolution of CSDs in some industrial systems. Finally, the fact that comagmatic CSDs are not often captured evolving systematically through large changes in nucleation rates, even in low crystallinity systems, may suggest that magma is always laced with high population densities of nuclei, supernuclei, and crystallites or clusters that together set the initial CSD at high characteristic population densities. Further evolution of the CSD occurs through sustained heterogeneous nucleation and rapid annealing at all crystallinities beginning at the liquidus itself and operating under more or less steady (not exponentially increasing) rates of nucleation.},

abstract = {Akutan is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian island arc. Studies involving seismic, GPS, and InSAR data have observed activity and deformation on the island since 1996. In this study we inverted measurements of volcanic deformation, observed using three components of motions at 12 continuous GPS sites to define magma source parameters using Mogi point source, Okada dislocation, and Yang spheroid and ellipsoid models. In order to analyze the evolution of this magma source we split the GPS data into five consecutive time periods, and one period that incorporates all available data. These time periods were designed around two inflation events in 2008 and 2014, when a sudden and significant increase in vertical velocity was observed. Inversion of these time periods independently allowed us to create a magma volume time-series that is related to the physical migration of magma defined by the estimated source parameters. The best fit model parameters resulting from these inversions describes magma storage in the form of an oblate spheroid centered on the northeastern rim of the caldera of Akutan volcano, extending from a depth of 7 km to 8 km, with a length of {\~{}} 3.5 km, a strike of {\~{}} N165°E, and a dip of {\~{}} 63° from the horizontal to the southwest. Our model results were compared with seismic studies and found to support previous interpretations of episodic inflation beneath Akutan volcano with complicated magma storage at intermediate depths. The inflation event observed in 2008 was estimated to be the result of an injection of magma of {\~{}} 0.08 km3that was followed in 2014 by an additional increase in volume of {\~{}} 0.06 km3. No periods of deflation were observed in the GPS data after these events, and we believe the total volume of magma accumulated in this region, {\~{}} 0.2 km3, remains in a shallow storage system beneath Akutan Volcano.},

abstract = {Lava solidification is controlled by two mechanisms: external cooling and gas exsolution, the latter inducing crystallization due to increasing liquidus temperature. The andesite lava dome of the Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat, is an extrusion dominated by crystallization caused by gas exsolution where cooling is unimportant in controlling emplacement. In the magma chamber the magma has an estimated viscosity of 7 x 10(6) Pa s. During ascent, gas exsolution caused the magma to extrude in a highly crystalline state, with only 5-15{\%} residual melt, viscosities in the range 10(13)-10(14) Pa s and mechanical strength {\textgreater} 1 MPa. Deformation can be heterogeneous with extrusion along shear zones. Rheological stiffening in the upper conduit also causes large overpressures, shallow seismicity, and cyclic patterns of dome extrusion. Gas-rich porphyritic andesites tend to be the least mobile kind of lava, because transition from magma into hot crystalline material was reached during ascent.},

abstract = {Aim of this paper is to identify variations in Very-Long-Period (VLP) source associated with eruptive style changes at Stromboli volcano (Italy) and to retrieve information about the shallow plumbing system that sustains the eruptive activity. We have considered a dataset of 74493 VLP events recorded during the period from January through August 2007, when an effusive eruption occurred (February 27-April 2). We performed a polarization analysis of the entire dataset and divided the considered period into four sub-periods on the basis of polarization characteristics. We then located the events and selected a subset of these events by applying a location quality threshold. The high quality locations demonstrate that during the effusive eruption the VLP sources first moved downward and then moved southwestward. To retrieve information about the geometry of the structures where the source processes take place, we further consider a subset of events and estimate their source mechanisms by using a moment tensor source function (MTSF) inversion technique. Inversion of the waveforms of the VLP events that occurred on February 27 allows us to obtain information about the dynamics of different source centroids distributed along different portions of the shallow magmatic conduits. The structure defined by the locations and source mechanisms shows a greater complexity compared with previous studies and their time variations give an insight into the kinematics of the eruption. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

Seismic, ground deformation and topographic measurements are compared with effusion rate during the 2007 Stromboli eruption, drawing an eruptive scenario that shifts our attention from the interior of the crust to the surface. The eruption is modelled as a gravity-driven drainage of magma stored in the volcanic edifice with a minor contribution of magma supplied at a steady rate from a deep reservoir. Here we show that the discharge rate can be predicted by the contraction of the volcano edifice and that the very-long-period seismicity migrates downwards, tracking the residual volume of magma in the shallow reservoir. Gravity-driven magma discharge dynamics explain the initially high discharge rates observed during eruptive crises and greatly influence our ability to predict the evolution of effusive eruptions.},

abstract = {Explosive eruptions of mafic magmas produce lava fountains whose heights are a function of the exsolved volatile content of the magma, its erupted mass flux, and the geometry of the vent (which may be an elongate fissure or a localized, near-circular conduit). The geometry of the initial vent (and the eruptive behaviour) can be distinctly modified by lava drainback and accumulating ejecta. Hot pyroclasts landing near the vent may coalesce to form rootless flows, some of which may drain back into the vent to be recycled into the eruption products. Rootless flows may be at least partially confined by pre-existing topographic features, or by spatter or cinder ramparts being built up by the eruption itself, so that they accumulate into a lava pond over and around the vent. The erupting jet of magmatic gas and pyroclasts must force its way through such a pond and will entrain some of the pond lava as it does so. The energy expended in entraining and accelerating previously erupted materials will reduce the eruption velocity and the lava fountain height by an amount which can be calculated as a function of the eruption conditions and the lava pond depth (or lava drainback rate). The results of such calculations are presented, and are used to assess the influence of this process on attempts to infer magma volatile contents from field observations of lava fountain heights.},

abstract = {Earthquake triggering of hydrothermal and volcanic systems is ubiquitous, but the underlying processes driving these systems are not well-understood. We numerically investigate the influence of seismic wave interaction with volcanic systems simulated as a trapped, high-pressure fluid reservoir connected to a fluid-filled fault system in a 2-D poroelastic medium. Different orientations and earthquake magnitudes are studied to quantify dynamic and static stress, and pore pressure changes induced by a seismic event. Results show that although the response of the system is mainly dominated by characteristics of the radiated seismic waves, local structures can also play an important role on the system dynamics. The fluid reservoir affects the seismic wave front, distorts the static overpressure pattern induced by the earthquake, and concentrates the kinetic energy of the incoming wave on its boundaries. The static volumetric stress pattern inside the fault system is also affected by the local structures. Our results show that local faults play an important role in earthquake-volcanic systems dynamics by concentrating kinetic energy inside and acting as wave-guides that have a breakwater-like behavior. This generates sudden changes in pore pressure, volumetric expansion, and stress gradients. Local structures also influence the regional Coulomb yield function. Our results show that local structures affect the dynamics of volcanic and hydrothermal systems, and should be taken into account when investigating triggering of these systems from nearby or distant earthquakes.},

The infrasound arrays consist of stations of the International Monitoring System global infrasound network and additional stations operated by the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources. Signals at the three closest recording stations IS44 (643 km, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Kamchatka Krai, Russia), IS45 (1690 km, Ussuriysk, Russia), and IS30 (1774 km, Isumi, Japan) represent a detailed record of the explosion chronology that correlates well with an eruption chronology based on satellite data (TERRA, NOAA, MTSAT). The eruption chronology inferred from infrasound data has a higher temporal resolution than that obtained with satellite data. Atmosphere-corrected infrasonic source locations determined from backazimuth cross-bearings of first-arrivals have a mean centroid {\~{}} 15 km from the true location of SP. Scatter in source locations of up to {\~{}} 100 km result from currently unresolved details of atmospheric propagation and source complexity. We observe systematic time-variations in trace-velocity, backazimuth deviation, and signal frequency content at IS44. Preliminary investigation of atmospheric propagation from SP to IS44 indicates that these variations can be attributed to solar tide variability in the thermosphere. It is well known that additional information about active volcanic processes can be learned by deploying infrasonic sensors with seismometers at erupting volcanoes. This study further highlights the significant potential of infrasound arrays for monitoring volcanic regions such as the Kurils that have only sparse seismic network coverage.},

abstract = {Multiphase flow in basaltic volcanic conduits is investigated using analog experiments and theoretical approaches. Depending on gas supply, large gas bubbles (gas slugs) may rise through basaltic magma in regimes of distinct fluid-dynamical behavior: ascent of single slugs, supplied slugs fed from the gas source during ascent, and periodic slug flow. An annular flow regime commences at the highest gas supply rates. A first set of experiments demonstrates that the growth of gas slugs due to hydrostatic decompression does not affect their ascent velocity and that excess pressure in the slugs remain negligible. The applicability of theoretical formulae describing slug ascent velocity as a function of liquid and conduit properties is evaluated in a second set of experiments. A third set of experiments with continuous gas supply into a cylindrical conduit are scaled to basaltic conditions over Morton, Eotvos, Reynolds, and Froude numbers. Gas flow rate and liquid viscosity are varied over the whole range of flow regimes to observe flow dynamics and to measure gas and liquid eruption rates. Foam generation by slug bursting at the surface and partial slug disruption by wake turbulence can modify the bubble content and size distribution of the magma. At the transition from slug to annular flow, when the liquid bridges between the gas slugs disappear, pressure at the conduit entrance drops by similar to 60{\%} from the hydrostatic value to the dynamic -flow resistance of the annular flow, which may trigger further degassing in a stored magma to maintain the annular flow regime until the gas supply is exhausted and the eruption ends abruptly. Magma discharge may also terminate when magma ascent is hindered by wall friction in long volcanic conduits and the annular gas flow erodes all magma from the conduit. Supplied slugs are found to reach much higher rise velocities than unsupplied slugs and to collapse to turbulent annular flow upon bursting at the surface. A fourth set of experiments uses a conduit partially blocked by built-in obstacles providing traps for gas pockets. Once gas pockets are filled, rising gas slugs deform but remain intact as they move around obstacles without coalescence or significant velocity changes. Bursting of bubbles coalescing with trapped gas pockets causes pressure signals at least 3 orders of magnitude more powerful than gas pocket oscillation induced by passing liquid. Our experiments suggest a refined classification of Strombolian and Hawaiian eruptions according to time-dependant behavior into sporadically pulsating lava fountains (driven by stochastic rise of single slugs), periodically pulsating lava fountains (resulting from slug flow), and quasi-steady lava fountains (oscillating at the frequency of annular-flow turbulence).},

abstract = {Stromboli Volcano in Italy is a persistently active, complex volcanic system. In May 2002 activity was confined to 3 major summit craters within which several active vents hosted multiple explosions each hour. During a 5-day field campaign an array of 3 low-frequency microphones was installed to investigate the coherent infrasound produced by degassing from these vents. Consistent phase lags across the 3 stations indicate distinct sources that are subsequently investigated to determine the associated vent location, apparent depth, and origin time. The cross-correlation routine allows for variations in comparison window length, waveform filtering bandwidth, and correlation and consistency thresholds, allowing for improved detection of certain types of degassing sources. Identification of activity at the various vents could be subsequently corroborated with 3 channels of synchronously acquired thermal data and video. During the May 2002 experiment persistent, energetic infrasound was observed from a passive degassing source within the Central Crater (CC) and transient infrasound, produced by discrete Strombolian explosions, was identified at 4 additional vents. The continuous infrasound produced by the CC exhibits variable frequency-dependent correlation lag times that are interpreted as a diffraction effect due to the acoustic radiator's recessed location within a steep-walled crater. Such dispersion has important implications for accurate eruption source modeling because it indicates that infrasonic waveforms may be significantly filtered during propagation. Transient explosion signals from the Northeast Crater (NEC) and Southwest Crater (SWC) vents also exhibit dynamic correlation lag times, but this scatter may be more reasonably attributed to variable epicentral locations. Explosions from the NEC west vent, for instance, appear to emanate from a diffuse zone with a lateral extent in excess of 10 m.},

abstract = {Lighthill's acoustic analogy and several variants of it have been used to interpret, analyze and explain measured data. In this paper, the validity of the main tenets of the classical theories is examined. This assessment is facilitated by a new comprehensive aeroacoustic database. The overall sound power level does not exactly follow the eighth power of velocity (Vj /a), but has a weak dependence on jet temperature. It has been believed that an additional source of noise, with either sixth or fourth power variation with velocity, appears for heated jets; there is also a supposed change in spectral shape at 90°, even though effects associated with convection and flow/acoustic interaction are negligible at that angle. The new data indicate that the velocity exponent for overall power is close to eight even at a very high stagnation temperature ratio of 3.2. Moreover, the spectral shape is invariant with jet Mach number and jet temperature. A careful assessment of Tanna's database, which provided the rationale and justification for many of the theoretical models, reveals that this database is unreliable and exhibits incorrect spectral trends. A fundamental tenet of the classical theories, based on both the formalisms of Lighthill- Ffowcs Williams and Lilley, is the notion of moving sources. This idea immediately leads to a Doppler shift for frequency and a convective amplification factor for the noise radiated to the aft angles. It is demonstrated with the new database that there is no experimental evidence for these conjectured effects of moving sources. The jet temperature ratio (static or stagnation), in addition to jet velocity Vj /a, is an independent controlling parameter. New scaling laws that are valid for all angles have been developed with the current database. There are no multiplicative factors with adjustable constants for the spectrum functions; the spectrum function and the velocity exponent depend on the jet temperature ratio and the radiation angle. This relation represents the main difference between the current and the classical formulations. A single exponent collapses the entire spectrum from jets with different Vj /a, but at fixed jet temperature ratio. Therefore, there is no experimental evidence for the main classical ideas of jet noise, as consisting of multipoles and moving sources, as they are inconsistent with the new data. The idea of two distinct sources that are related to the fine-scale and large-scale turbulence of the jet plume has been investigated. Experimental evidence for the importance of the noise from large coherent structures even at low velocities is offered. The observation at lower and large aft angles of distinct characteristics in, (1) the far field spectral shapes, (2) the directivities of the peak Strouhal number and the OASPL, (3) the directivity of the velocity exponent, and (4) the polar and azimuthal correlations of the farfield pressure, provides strong evidence to support the above view of two different sources of jet noise.},

abstract = {Between 1999 and 2004 we deployed a series of thermal infrared experiments at Stromboli volcano (Italy) to thermally define the dynamics of gas puffing. These experiments involved targeting degassing vents with thermal infrared thermometers and thermal imagers from a distance of ?300 m. The data showed that puffs involved a short- lived gas thrust phase (velocities up to ?20 m/s) followed by a dominant phase of buoyant rise with constant ascent velocities (?7 m/s), until cooling caused the puff to stall and disperse. The puff could best be described as a starting plume that rapidly developed into a thermal. Ascent velocities, puff volumes and frequencies were extremely stable over the 6-year-long study period, typically being 10 ± 5 m/s, 50–190 m3 per burst and 0.5–1 Hz, respectively. These volumes convert to puff masses of 10–40 kg and give a total gas flux of 7–26 kg/s. Although stable at the system as a whole, at a single vent, gas puffing showed short-term variation and instability. Gas puffing would wax and wane at individual vents, shifting to other linked vents so that for the system has a whole, puffing activity was maintained. Variations in vent temperature can thus be tied to variations in gas flux, where termination of gas puff activity (a reduction in the flux) at a particular vent results in decreased vent temperature. We suggest that gas puffing is related to a rapid and repeated release (bursting) of gas slugs at the head of the magma column, at a rate of one every 1–2 s. Released gas packets then ascend the empty conduit section to be emitted as the puffing plume. This style of degassing activity persists between Strombolian explosions and operates alongside passive degassing; but has a very different source mechanism. It appears to represent a highly stable and repetitive, but extremely mild, stream of explosive bursts. This style of nonpassive degassing may account for up to 45{\%} of Stromboli's total gas flux.},

abstract = {To visualize the behavior of erupting magma in volcanic conduits, we performed shock tube experiments on the ductile-brittle response of a viscoelastic medium to diffusion-driven bubble expansion. A sample of shear-thinning magma analogue is saturated by gas Ar under high pressure. On rapid decompression, Ar supersaturation causes bubbles to nucleate, grow, and coalesce in the sample, forcing it to expand, flow, and fracture. Experimental variables include saturation pressure and duration, and shape and lubrication of the flow path. Bubble growth in the experiments controls both flow and fracturing, and is consistent with physical models of magma vesiculation. Two types of fractures are observed: i) sharp fractures along the uppermost rim of the sample, and ii) fractures pervasively diffused throughout the sample. Rim fractures open when shear stress accumulates and strain rate is highest at the margin of the flow (a process already inferred from observations and models to occur in magma). Pervasive fractures originate when wall-friction retards expansion of the sample, causing pressure to build-up in the bubbles. When bubble pressure overcomes wall-friction and the tensile strength of the porous sample, fractures open with a range of morphologies. Both types of fracture open normally to flow direction, and both may heal as the flow proceeds. These experiments also illustrate how the development of pervasive fractures allows exsolving gas to escape from the sample before the generation of a permeable network via other processes, e.g., bubble coalescence. This is an observation that potentially impact the degassing of magma and the transition between explosive and effusive eruptions. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The 1631 eruption of Mount Vesuvius was the most destructive episode in the recent volcanic history of Vesuvius and the last in which large pyroclastic flows were emitted. The controversy about whether lava flows were also generated in this eruption, as sustained in the mapping by Le Hon (1866) and by the interpretation by some authors (Burri et al., 1975; Rolandi et al., 1991) of eyewitness accounts, is important not only for a better understanding of the eruption but also for the implications in the prediction of volcanic hazards of this volcano, set in an overpopulated area with more than 3 million people potentially at risk. Short-period palaeomagnetic techniques (secular variation curve) have been applied to correlate lava flows interpreted as produced in the event of 1631 with the pyroclastic flow of this same eruption and other lava flows unquestionably emitted prior to this eruptive event. The model that best fits the results obtained suggests that the presumed 1631 lava flows were not the result of a single eruptive event but were, in fact, produced by several different eruptions. These lava flows also have a better palaeomagnetic correlation with the medieval lava flows than with the pyroclastic flow of 1631, whose juvenile pumice clasts have a well-defined single component magnetization that fits in the expected corresponding position of the secular variation curve for that age. The palaeomagnetic characteristics of the 1631 pyroclastic flow are compatible with a "hot" depositional temperature (apparently above the Curie point of magnetite, 585 ??C) for the juvenile pumice fragments (magmatic fraction) and a "cold" deposition for the non-magmatic fraction. This suggests the lack of thermal equilibration during transport of the larger clasts, probably due to the short distance travelled by the pyroclastic flows. The main volcanological and volcanic hazard issues of this work are that the 1631 event was entirely explosive and that pyroclastic flow activity played a major role in the eruption. Before 1631 Vesuvius remained for about five centuries in a state of quiescence. If the present period of repose continues for decades or centuries it is increasingly likely that the next eruption will be a highly dangerous explosive event similar to that of 1631. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {Magma flow during explosive volcanic eruptions has been described assuming rigid conduits with simple cylindrical or planar geometries. Here we study the dynamics of explosive volcanic flows to take account of the role of elastic deformation of the conduit influenced by local magmatic pressure. Three cases are investigated: a dyke with elliptical cross-section, a cylindrical conduit and a deep dyke connected to a shallow cylinder. The model CPIUC (Macedonio et al., 2005) was used for simulations and generalized to account for elastic deformations of the conduit cross-section area due to magmatic overpressure. Fragmentation level is typically deeper in a dyke than in a cylinder. For flows in wide dykes pressure at the fragmentation depth can be lower than the surrounding lithostatic pressure by several tens of MPa, indicating that the wall-rocks of the dyke will be unstable, constraining the dyke width and eventually blocking the eruption. On the other hand, when the fragmentation level is shallow the corresponding lithostatic pressure is not large enough to close the dyke and eruptions from wide dykes are possible. The behaviour changes drastically when we assume the conduit is a dyke at depth that evolves to a cylinder near the surface. In this case even very wide dykes can be stable because the fragmentation level moves into the cylindrical region where deformation is negligible. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We investigated the coupled effects of gas escape and crystallization on the dynamics of lava dome eruptions using a one-dimensional conduit flow model. The relationship between chamber pressure pch and mass flow rate q for steady conduit flow commonly has a regime of negative differential resistance (i.e., dpch/dq {\textless} 0), which causes a transition from lava dome to explosive eruption. Two positive-feedback mechanisms that result in negative differential resistance have been identified. First, effective magma viscosity decreases with increasing q because of a delay of crystallization, leading to reduced viscous wall friction (feedback 1). Second, magma porosity increases with increasing q because of less efficient gas escape, leading to reduced gravitational load (feedback 2). For high-phenocryst-content magma (volume fraction {\textgreater}0.5), feedback 1 is the main mechanism that forms negative differential resistance. In this case, the transition from lava dome to explosive eruption occurs when the magma supply rate exceeds a fixed critical value. For low-phenocryst-content magma (volume fraction {\textless}0.5), feedback 2 plays a key role so that the transition is controlled by the permeability of the surrounding rocks; the critical magma supply rate remarkably decreases with decreasing permeability. Transition due to feedback 2 is associated with a change in the chemical composition of volcanic gas, a drastic increase in magma porosity from nearly 0 to greater than 0.8, and overpressure at a shallower level, which can be detected from geochemical and geophysical field observations.},

abstract = {In the most basic seismo-acoustic studies at volcanoes, infrasound monitoring enables differentiation between sub-surface seismicity and the seismicity associated with gas release. Under optimal conditions, complicated degassing signals can be understood, relative explosion size can be assessed, and variable seismo-acoustic energy partitioning can be interpreted. The extent to which these points may be investigated depends upon the quality of the infrasonic records (a function of background wind noise, microphone sensitivity, and microphone array geometry) and the type of activity generated by the volcano (frequency of explosions, bandwidth of the signals, and coupling efficiency of the explosion to elastic energy). To illustrate the features, benefits, and limitations of infrasonic recordings at volcanoes, we showcase acoustic and seismic records from five volcanoes characterized by explosive degassing. These five volcanoes (Erebus in Antarctica, Karymsky in Russia, and Sangay, Tungurahua, and Pichincha in Ecuador) were the focus of seismo-acoustic experiments between 1997 and 2000. Each case study provides background information about the volcanic activity, an overview of visual observations during the period of monitoring, and examples of seismo-acoustic data. We discuss the benefits and utility of the infrasound study at each respective volcano. Finally, we compare the infrasound records and eruptive activity from these volcanoes with other volcanoes that have been the focus of previous seismo-acoustic experiments. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {At Kukedo, northern Shimane Peninsula, SW Japan, volcaniclastic (peperite) dikes extend parallel to andesitic dikes in volcaniclastic turbidites of the middle Miocene Takashibiyama Formation. They mainly comprise a poorly sorted mixture of volcaniclasts derived from the host volcaniclastic turbidites. Andesitic dikes in direct contact with the volcaniclastic turbidites have fluidal contacts, locally protruding into the volcaniclastic turbidites. Volcaniclastic beds are disorganized in a zone up to 1 m wide and are partly welded within 1-30 cm from the contacts. One major volcaniclastic dike 0.5-1.5 m wide extends upwards from the lower segment to the upper segment of a laterally offset andesitic dike (1.5-3 m wide). Coarse lithic clasts are locally concentrated along the wall of the dike, and juvenile clasts derived from the andesitic dike are sparsely set in the poorly sorted volcaniclastic mixture. Juvenile clasts are poorly vesicular and microcrystalline, and mainly polyhedral in shape. Sparse fluidal juvenile clasts are fractured in situ into small clasts by quench cracks. Fluidization of host volcaniclastic turbidites occured to form volcaniclastic dikes during emplacement of andesitic dikes, driven by the excess pore fluid pressure imparted from the stress-concentration at the advancing magma head and heating of pore water in the host volcaniclastic beds. The volcaniclastic dike extending directly from the andesitic dike was produced by small-scale dynamic mixing of magma and watery volcaniclastic beds upon offsetting of the andesitic dike. Welding was favored by the increased water vapor pressures and high temperatures in direct contact with andesitic dikes. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Investigation of well-exposed volcaniclastic deposits of Shiveluch volcano indicates that large-scale failures have occurred at least eight times in its history: approximately 10,000, 5700, 3700, 2600, 1600, 1000, 600 C-14 BP and 1964 AD. The volcano was stable during the Late Pleistocene, when a large cone was formed (Old Shiveluch), and became unstable in the Holocene when repetitive collapses of a portion of the edifice (Young Shiveluch) generated debris avalanches. The transition in stability was connected with a change in composition of the erupting magma (increased SiO2 from ca. 55-56{\%} to 60-62{\%}) that resulted in an abrupt increase of viscosity and the production of lava domes. Each failure was triggered by a disturbance of the volcanic edifice related to the ascent of a new batch of viscous magma. The failures occurred before magma intruded into the upper part of the edifice, suggesting that the trigger mechanism was indirectly associated with magma and involved shaking by a moderate to large volcanic earthquake and/or enhancement of edifice pore pressure due to pressurised juvenile gas. The failures typically included: (a) a retrogressive landslide involving backward rotation of slide blocks; (b) fragmentation of the leading blocks and their transformation into a debris avalanche, while the trailing slide blocks decelerate and soon come to rest: and (c) long-distance runout of the avalanche as a transient wave of debris with yield strength that glides on a thin weak laver of mixed facies developed at the avalanche base. Ail the failures of Young Shiveluch were immediately followed by explosive eruptions that developed along a similar pattern. The slope failure was the first event, followed by a plinian eruption accompanied by partial fountain collapse and the emplacement of pumice flows. In several cases the slope failure depressurised the hydrothermal system to cause phreatic explosions that preceded the magmatic eruption. The collapse-induced plinian eruptions were moderate-sized and ordinary events in the history of the volcano. No evidence for directed blasts was found associated with any of the slope failures.},

abstract = {The dynamics of separated two-phase flow of basaltic magmas in cylindrical conduits has been explored combining large-scale experiments and theoretical studies. Experiments consisted of the continuous injection of air into water or glucose syrup in a 0.24 m diameter, 6.5 m long bubble column. The model calculates vesicularity and pressure gradient for a range of gas superficial velocities (volume flow rates/pipe area, 10{\&}{\#}8722;2{\&}{\#}8211;102 m/s), conduit diameters (100{\&}{\#}8211;2 m), and magma viscosities (3{\&}{\#}8211;300 Pa s). The model is calibrated with the experimental results to extrapolate key flow parameters such as Co (distribution parameter) and Froude number, which control the maximum vesicularity of the magma in the column, and the gas rise speed of gas slugs. It predicts that magma vesicularity increases with increasing gas volume flow rate and decreases with increasing conduit diameter, until a threshold value (45 vol.{\%}), which characterizes churn and annular flow regimes. Transition to annular flow regimes is expected to occur at minimum gas volume flow rates of 103{\&}{\#}8211;104 m3/s. The vertical pressure gradient decreases with increasing gas flow rates and is controlled by magma vesicularity (in bubbly flows) or the length and spacing of gas slugs. This study also shows that until conditions for separated flow are met, increases in magma viscosity favor stability of slug flow over bubbly flow but suggests coexistence between gas slugs and small bubbles, which contribute to a small fraction of the total gas outflux. Gas flow promotes effective convection of the liquid, favoring magma homogeneity and stable conditions.},

abstract = {Volcanic tremor is a ubiquitous feature of explosive eruptions. This oscillation persists for minutes to weeks and is characterized by a remarkably narrow band of frequencies from about 0.5 Hz to 7 Hz (refs 1-4). Before major eruptions, tremor can occur in concert with increased gas flux and related ground deformation. Volcanic tremor is thus of particular value for eruption forecasting. Most models for volcanic tremor rely on specific properties of the geometry, structure and constitution of volcanic conduits as well as the gas content of the erupting magma. Because neither the initial structure nor the evolution of the magma-conduit system will be the same from one volcano to the next, it is surprising that tremor characteristics are so consistent among different volcanoes. Indeed, this universality of tremor properties remains a major enigma. Here we employ the contemporary view that silicic magma rises in the conduit as a columnar plug surrounded by a highly vesicular annulus of sheared bubbles. We demonstrate that, for most geologically relevant conditions, the magma column will oscillate or 'wag' against the restoring 'gas-spring' force of the annulus at observed tremor frequencies. In contrast to previous models, the magma-wagging oscillation is relatively insensitive to the conduit structure and geometry, which explains the narrow band of tremor frequencies observed around the world. Moreover, the model predicts that as an eruption proceeds there will be an upward drift in both the maximum frequency and the total signal frequency bandwidth, the nature of which depends on the explosivity of the eruption, as is often observed.},

Plumes emitted during short-lived (discrete) eruptions have been modeled as discrete thermals or rooted thermals. Based on the one-dimensional model for the rise of a discrete thermal, the initial buoyancy, F0, of a spherical thermal can theoretically be estimated from the maximum plume height and a vertical profile of ambient air density. We here examine the relationship between infrasound-derived volume, Vinf, and the buoyancy-derived volume, Vb, as derived from F0, which depends on gravity acceleration, and the difference in density between the thermal and surrounding air, to understand how Vinf relates to the dynamics of the eruption plume. We analyze infrasound data accompanying Vulcanian and phreatic eruptions at Aso, Shinmoedake, and Lokon-Empung volcanoes to estimate Vinf, and consider Vinf from other volcanoes. We obtain a representative ratio of Vb/Vinf of 16 by examining 53 events. Because the analyzed infrasound signals share a prominent pressure pulse at the onset, we regard Vinf as the volume of the plume at initiation, i.e., as a jet. Instead, we consider Vb as the thermal volume when it has entrained a sufficient amount of the surrounding air and obtains F0. Comparison of the bulk density of the jet and the discrete thermal yields a rate of volume change between both regimes by a factor of 1.8–32, which is consistent with the ratio of Vb/Vinf. Our result provides an effective index to constrain erupted plume volume using infrasound data with real-time monitoring systems.},

abstract = {Using values of viscosity and its temperature dependence, density, heat capacity and thermal conductivity appropriate to rhyolitic liquids an analysis of the macroscopic heat balances of these liquids flowing under constant stress has been carried out. The analysis shows that for shear couples and shear stresses expected in the flow of silicic lava on the earth's surface thermal feedback may occur after time periods ranging from a few seconds to several days and may cause rapid increases in temperature. For silicic magmas flowing in a dike or circular conduit under a constant pressure gradient these thermal instabilities may occur after a few days to several weeks for dike half thicknesses or conduit radii ranging from a few centimeters to a few meters. For silicic lava flows this phenomenon may be important in producing commonly observed flow structures such as pumiceous banding and color banding. Local temperature increases would have the effect of reducing local water solubility, increasing diffusion rates, and increasing nucleation and growth rates of vapor bubbles, thus causing highly vesicular bands that parallel the shear planes. Temperature increases could also cause increases in fO2 within a fluid layer resulting in oxidation and red color banding. For silicic lavas flowing in dikes or conduits, the possible thermal instabilities are accompanied by instabilities in volume rate of flow which may contribute to rapid vesiculation of upward-moving magma and result in explosive volcanism. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {New volume estimates and 40Ar/39Ar ages for the Tasmantid Seamounts are reported to investigate the origin of volcanism and potential links between volcanism and changes in the speed and direction of migration of the Australian plate during the Cenozoic. The results show that the average extrusive volume of individual volcanoes along the seamount chain is 2587 ± 3078 km3 (1 s), and that volumes generally increase towards the south. An exception, the Britannia Guyot, located in the middle of the seamount chain, is the most voluminous (11,374 km3). Nineteen new 40Ar/39Ar ages, from Wreck to Gascoyne, show that the emplacement of the Tasmantid Seamounts occurred between 33.2 ± 1.5 and 6.5 ± 0.6 Ma. A single linear regression applied to the age versus latitude data, assuming volcanism to be caused by plate migration over a stationary hotspot, reveals a plate migration rate of 62 ± 2 kmMa− 1 (R2 = 0.97; n = 27) between {\~{}} 33 and 6 Ma. However, the bend in the seamount track, corresponding with the period of largest eruptive volumes, suggests three distinct segments in the Tasmantid age versus latitude data. The northern segment is consistent with a plate migration rate of 75 ± 10 kmMa− 1 (R2 = 0.88; n = 10) and the southern segment reveals a plate migration rate of 64 ± 4 kmMa− 1 (R2 = 0.94; n = 17). The period between these two segments, from {\~{}} 25 to 19 Ma, overlaps with the period of slow migration and change in the direction of the Australian plate derived from the age versus latitude distribution of continental central volcanoes. The new Tasmantid Seamount results support the interpretation that there were changes in the velocity and direction to Australia's northward trajectory, possibly resulting from a series of collisional events.},

abstract = {Remnants of an extensive maar-diatreme volcanic field are magnificently exposed at various depths of erosion in the Hopi Buttes volcanic field of northeastern Arizona. Field and petrographic studies of both the maar and diatreme elements of a selection of volcanoes within the field show that: (1) lower sections of the maar rim sequences are typically rich in sandy mudrock derived from the pre-eruptive Mio-Pliocene Bidahochi Formation, and the muddy Bidahochi sediment was soft and wet at the time of maar eruptions; (2) beds higher within the rims contain generally increased proportions of sandstone clasts from the Triassic Wingate Formation. In the diatremes, late-emplaced breccia has deeper-seated lithics than more marginal breccia emplaced earlier; and (3) many vents are topped by megacryst-enriched scoria and spatter, and deep-seated xenoliths are known only from upper diatreme and craterfilling tephra. These observations show that: (1) eruptions at Hopi Buttes involved interaction of magma with unconsolidated mudrock at shallow levels, and the phreatomagmatic processes that provided the bulk of the energy involved in the violent eruptions were driven by the interaction of magma and wet sediment; (2) the locus of explosive activity migrated downward as eruptions progressed; and (3) the closing stage of many eruptions was characterized by rapid magma rise and relative depletion of water. {\textcopyright} 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {We investigate the transient behavior of bubble deformation in magma. Previous studies have used the relationships between capillary number and equilibrium shape for a single bubble under either steady simple shear or steady pure shear to estimate strain rates in pyroclasts and to calculate bubble shapes in a conduit flow. We developed a deformation model for a bubble by adjusting the empirical functions used in an existing model for a droplet to fit experimental data for bubble deformation. The modified model was used to calculate transient large deformations of a single bubble in arbitrary shear flows. In this paper, we demonstrate the significance of the modified model through two different applications. Firstly, using this model, we are able to simulate the entire history of the evolution of bubble shapes in a time dependent flow using the computational code, Conflow. In this simulation, we further include the effect of gas expansion on the bubble shape. From this simulation, we show that bubble deformation in conduit flow is controlled by the history of both capillary number and strain. Secondly, by using this model to analyze bubble shapes observed in natural magma samples, we are able to better estimate the strain rates and deformation durations. We apply this model to certain transient features in the relationship between bubble shape and radius in the published data of},

abstract = {Four different rheological models for large deformations of elastic-viscoplastic materials are considered. Each model is hyperelastic with the stress being determined by derivatives of a strain energy function. Model 1 is based on a nonlinear evolution equation for a unimodular elastic distortional deformation tensor and is considered to be the reference model since it includes the special case of a nonlinear isotropic elastic solid. Models 2-4 are based on simplified evolution equations which depend linearly on a deviatoric elastic strain tensor. Equations of this type have been used to model non-Newtonian fluids. The main objective of this paper is to examine the influence of approximations introduced to obtain these simplified evolution equations. Examples of steady-state simple shear and steady-state isochoric extension relative to a rotating coordinate system are used to study the response of the simplified models. In particular, it is shown that these simplified models predict the unphysical result that the shear stress decreases towards zero for large values of the rate of deformation in simple shear. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study examines magma ascent processes of three basic types prior to intermittent explosions such as Vulcanian or Strombolian types: specifically their relations to volcano ground deformation. Such repetitive explosions eject magma from an open conduit at short time intervals. Consequently, magma pressure is expected to decrease at the conduit and/or reservoir, and thereby deflate the volcano. Then, magma within the conduit rises, exerting normal and shear stresses on the conduit wall, thereby inflating the volcano. Diffusive mass transfer of water molecules from the melt to bubbles might occur subject to a sudden depressurization by eruption when magma includes numerous small gas bubbles. Such gas bubble expansion lifts the magma in the conduit. Calculations of ground deformation on a semi-infinite medium for such rising magma show that vertical and radial displacements and tilt motions recorded in the far fields are proportional to the 1.5 power of time. For low-viscosity magma, gas bubbles might rise in the melt because of buoyancy force. The gas bubbles expand rapidly with time because of decreased ambient pressure, pushing the magma upward in the conduit. Consequently, the volcano slowly inflates initially; then the rate of deformation increases over time, eventually engendering a rapid inflation immediately before eruption. These temporal changes in ground deformations contrast against cases in which magma does not include gas bubbles. In such cases, amplitudes of ground deformation increase almost linearly or even decrease with time at far fields. These differences, which are recognized as basic characteristics of temporal changes of ground deformation, enable us to know the driving forces of magma in an open conduit and to evaluate the gas bubble behavior quantitatively in magma before eruption. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We performed a stability analysis of a conduit flow model by Barmin et al. [Barmin, A., Melnik, O., Sparks, R.S.J., 2002. Periodic behavior in lava dome eruptions. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 199 (1-2), 173–184], in which the periodic variations in magma flow rate and chamber pressure are reproduced as a result of the temporal and spatial changes of the magma viscosity controlled by the kinetics of crystallization. The model is reduced to a dynamical system where the time derivatives of the magma flow rate (dQ/dt) and the chamber pressure (dP/dt) are functions of Q and P evaluated at a shifted time t−t⁎. Here, the time delay t⁎ represents the time for the viscosity of fluid particle to increase in a conduit. The dynamical system with time delay is approximated by a simple two-dimensional dynamical system of Q and P where t⁎ is given as a parameter. The results of our linear stability analyses for these dynamical systems indicate that the transition from steady to periodic flow depends on nonlinearities in the steady state relation between Q and P. The steady state relation shows a sigmoidal curve in Q−P phase plane; its slope has negative values at intermediate flow rates. The steady state solutions become unstable, and hence P and Q oscillate periodically, when the negative slope of the steady state relation ([dP/dQ]S) exceeds a critical value; that is [dP/dQ]S{\textless}−t⁎$\gamma$/(2Vch), where Vch is the chamber volume and $\gamma$ is an elastic constant which is related to the rigidity of chamber wall. We also found that the period and the pattern of oscillation of the conduit flow primarily depend on a quantity defined by LVch/r4, where L is the conduit length and r is the conduit radius.},

abstract = {During the 2000 activity of Miyake-jima volcano, Japan, we detected long period seismic signals with initial pulse widths of 1-2 s, accompanied by infrasonic pulses with almost the same pulse widths. The seismic signals were observed from 13 July 2000, a day before the second summit eruption. The occurrences of the seismic signals were intermittent with a gradual increase in their magnitudes and numbers building toward a significant explosive eruption on 18 August. After the eruption, the seismic and infrasonic events ceased. The results of a waveform inversion show that the initial motions were excited by an isotropic inflation source beneath the south edge of the caldera at a depth of 1.4 km. On the other hand, the sources of the infrasonic pulses were located in the summit caldera area. The times at which the infrasonic pulses were emitted at the surface were delayed by about 3 s from the origin times of the seismic events. It is suggested that small isotropic inflations excited seismic waves in the crust and simultaneously caused acoustic waves that traveled in the conduit and produced infrasonic pulses at the crater bottom. Considering the observed time differences and gas temperatures emitted from the vent, the conduit should have been filled with vapor mixed with SO2gas and volcanic ash. The change of the time differences between the seismic and infrasonic signals suggests that the seismic source became shallower within half a day before the August 18 explosive eruption. We interpret the source process as a fragmentation process of magma in which gas bubbles burst and quickly released part of the pressure that had been sustained by the tensional strength of magma. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Such rocky objects of approximately lunar mass (∼0.01 M⊕) ought to be differentiated, such that nearly all of their HSE payload is sequestered into iron cores. Here, we analyze the mechanical and chemical fate of the core of such a Late Veneer impactor, and trace how its HSEs are suspended – and thus pollute – the mantle. For the statistically most-likely oblique collision (∼45°), the impactor's core elongates and thereafter disintegrates into a metallic hail of small particles (∼10 m). Some strike the orbiting Moon as sesquinary impactors, but most re-accrete to Earth as secondaries with further fragmentation. We show that a single oblique impactor provides an adequate amount of HSEs to the primordial terrestrial silicate reservoirs via oxidation of ({\textless}m-sized) metal particles with a hydrous, pre-impact, early Hadean Earth.},

abstract = {The Ottaviano eruption occurred in the late neolithic (8000 y B.P.). 2.40 km3 of phonolitic pyroclastic material (0.61 km3 DRE) were emplaced as pyroclastic flow, surge and fall deposits. The eruption began with a fall phase, with a model column height of 14 km, producing a pumice fall deposit (LA). This phase ended with short-lived weak explosive activity, giving rise to a fine-grained deposit (L1), passing to pumice fall deposits as the result of an increasing column height and mass discharge rate. The subsequent two fall phases (producing LB and LC deposits), had model column heights of 20 and 22 km with eruption rates of 2.5 × 107 and 2.81 × 107 kg/s, respectively. These phases ended with the deposition of ash layers (L2 and L3), related to a decreasing, pulsing explosive activity. The values of dynamic parameters calculated for the eruption classify it as a sub-plinian event. Each fall phase was characterized by variations in the eruptive intensity, and several pyroclastic flows were emplaced (F1 to F3). Alternating pumice and ash fall beds record the waning of the eruption. Finally, owing to the collapse of a eruptive column of low gas content, the last pyroclastic flow (F4) was emplaced. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {A volcanic model is proposed. The model consists of a magma reservoir, which is a spherical hole in an elastic medium and is being replenished from below, and a conduit which is a circular cylinder in a visco-elastic medium. The model is expressed by a system of two coupled nonlinear differential equations. We solve the system as an initial value problem with a source term corresponding to the magma supply. The supply rate is expressed by a bell shape function with a constant part. This model works as follows: Supplied magma to the reservoir at a given rate increases pressure inside the reservoir. The increased pressure expands the conduit, through which the magma is discharged with the rate determined by Poiseuille's flow law. Although the system eventually goes to a steady state in which the in- and out-flows are balanced, the difference between response times of the reservoir and conduit causes the oscillation of the discharge rate. This means that a volcanic activity oscillates. For a pulse input expressed by a bell shape function, the number of oscillations increases when the amount of inflow magma increases. This model is applied to the recent volcanic activities of Mt. Unzen. The model well simulates the semi-long term (few years) variation of the discharge rate of lava with a plausible replenishment rate of magma. Geometrical factors of the volcanic system (the volume and radius of the reservoir, the maximum and average radii of the conduit) and some physical constants (the maximum excess pressure, viscosity of the country rock and Mogi's coefficient) are estimated under assumptions on the following quantities; density difference between the country rock and magma, rigidity of the country rock, bulk modulus and viscosity of magma. All quantities calculated except the viscosity agrees with corresponding values determined by independent methods within a factor of two or three. We discussed physical background of these results together with the model itself. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A steady-state, one-dimensional, and nonhomogeneous two-phase flow model was developed for the prediction of local flow properties in volcanic conduits. The model incorporates the effects of relative velocity between the phases and for the variable magma viscosity. The resulting set of nonlinear differential equations was solved by a stiff numerical solver and the results were verified with the results of basaltic fissure eruptions obtained by a homogeneous two-phase flow model, before applying the model to the eruptions of Mt. St. Helens and Vesuvius volcanoes. This verification, and a study of the sensitivity of several modeling parameters, proved effective in establishing the confidence in the predicted nonequilibrium results of flow distribution in the conduits when the mass flow rate is critical or maximum. The application of the model to the plinian eruptions of Mt. St. Helens on May 18, 1980, and Vesuvius in AD 79, demonstrates the sensitivity of the magma discharge rate and distributions of pressure, volumetric fraction, and velocities of phases, on the hydrous magma viscosity feeding the volcanic conduits. Larger magma viscosities produce smaller mass discharge rates (or greater conduit diameters), smaller exit pressures, larger disequilibrium between the phases, and larger difference between the local lithostatic and fluid pressures in the conduit. This large pressure difference occurs when magma fragments and may cause a rupture of the conduit wall rocks, producing a closure of the conduit and cessation of the volcanic eruption, or water pouring into the conduit from underground aquifers leading to phreatomagmatic explosions. The motion of the magma fragmentation zone along a conduit during an eruption can be caused by the varying viscosity of magma feeding the volcanic conduit and may cause intermittent phreatomagmatic explosions during the plinian phases as different underground aquifers are activated at different depths. The variation of magma viscosity during the eruptions of Mt. St. Helens in 1980 and Vesuvius in AD 79 is normally associated with the tapping of magmas from different depths of the magma chambers. This variation of viscosity, which can include different crystal and dissolved water contents, can also produce conduit wall erosion, the onset and collapse of volcanic columns above the vent, and the onset and cessation of pyroclastic flows and surges. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {A 14-year-long microgravity data set (October 1994 to September 2007) collected along a 24-km east-west trending profile of 19 stations was analyzed to detect underground mass redistributions related to the volcanic activity involving the southern flank of Mt Etna (Italy). A multiresolution wavelet analysis was applied to separate the volcano-related anomalies from the unwanted components. The residual image having both spatial extension and temporal duration evidenced two complete gravity increase/decrease cycles mainly affecting the central and eastern stations of the profile. The first gravity increase (early 1995 to the end of 1996) and decrease (end of 1996 to late in 1998) cycle reached a maximum amplitude of approximately 90 $\mu$Gal. The second gravity increase (mid-1999 to mid-2000) and decrease (mid-2000 to early-2004) cycle attained an amplitude of about 80 $\mu$Gal. After about 5 years of a persistent negative gravity anomaly, a new semicycle started at the end of 2006 and continued during the last survey carried out in September 2007. The density changes, modeled over time since 1994 using a Quadratic Programming algorithm, are mainly located at a depth of 2--4 km bsl in a region recognized to be a preferential pathway of magma rising and an intermediate zone of magma storage/withdrawal. The computed positive mass variations of about 105 × 109 kg were interpreted as magma accumulation, while negative mass changes of about −120 × 109 kg were associated with either magma drainage or opening of new voids by tectonic stresses within a source volume, where tensional earthquakes occurred.},

abstract = {Geophysical models have traditionally treated diapiric ascent as occurring in purely viscous host rock, and dike intrusion as occurring in purely elastic host rock. Such models are incapable of determining (1) what governs the transition between the two transport mechanisms, (2) the properties of diapirs that ascend via a combination of fracture and flow, and (3) the geologic regimes in which such hybrid behavior might occur. Observations that granitic plutons often intrude along crustal-scale faults suggest that transitional behavior may be important geologically. Here I explore a self-similar solution for a pressurized dike propagating in a linear viscoelastic medium. Dike growth is governed primarily by the ratio of two dimensionless parameters. The first, a measure of the elastic response of the host rock, is ( po G), where po is excess magma pressure at the dike entrance and G is elastic stiffness of the host rock. The second, a measure of the viscous response of the host rock, is ( $\eta$m $\eta$r)1 3, where $\eta$m is magma viscosity and $\eta$r is host-rock viscosity. For expected values of ( po G) of 10-3 to 10-4, the host rock must be more than 11 to 14 orders of magnitude more viscous than the magma in order to behave as essentially elastic during dike intrusion. Dike thickness:length aspect ratios less than 10-1 require viscosity contrasts in excess of 6 to 8 orders of magnitude. These results indicate that rock will behave elastically during the intrusion of basalt and low-viscosity rhyolite dikes, but that viscous deformation can significantly exceed elastic deformation during intrusion of the most viscous rhyolite dikes into hot rock. Even in the latter case, however, the resulting intrusions appear dike-like. Thus while these results can explain the occurrence of rhyolite dikes with aspect ratios of 10-2 rather than the 10-3 to 10-4 expected for purely elastic host rock, the occurrence of granites in equidimensional plutons cannot be attributed solely to the viscosity contrast between liquid granites and hot rock. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {K2 is a steep-sided kimberlite pipe with a complex internal geology. Geological mapping, logging of drillcore and petrographic studies indicate that it comprises layered breccias and pyroclastic rocks of various grain sizes, lithic contents and internal structures. The pipe comprises two geologically distinct parts: K2 West is a layered sequence of juvenile- and lithic-rich breccias, which dip 20-45A degrees inwards, and K2 East consists of a steep-sided pipe-like body filled with massive volcaniclastic kimberlite nested within the K2 pipe. The layered sequence in K2 West is present to {\textgreater} 900 m below present surface and is interpreted as a sequence of pyroclastic rocks generated by explosive eruptions and mass-wasting breccias generated by rock fall and sector collapse of the pipe walls: both processes occurred in tandem during the infill of the pipe. Several breccia lobes extend across the pipe and are truncated by the steep contact with K2 East. Dense pyroclastic rocks within the layered sequence are interpreted as welded deposits. K2 East represents a conduit that was blasted through the layered breccia sequence at a late stage in the eruption. This phase may have involved fluidisation of trapped pyroclasts, with loss of fine particles and comminution of coarse clasts. We conclude that the K2 kimberlite pipe was emplaced in several distinct stages that consisted of an initial explosive enlargement, followed by alternating phases of accumulation and ejection.},

abstract = {The Stromboli volcano erupted on February 27, 2007, after an intense Strombolian activity lasted about 2??months. The eruption was characterized by a series of rapidly evolving phenomena, like the propagation of an effusive fracture along the crater rim, the opening of lateral effusive vents, an unusually large effusive flux ({\textgreater} 10??m
                        3/s), the collapse of the crater system, and a major strombolian explosion. This eruption was monitored by an integrated network of multiparameter instruments: broad-band seismometers, infrasonic array, thermal cameras and bore-hole tiltmeters. All the information collected and processed in real-time allowed to draw a clear picture of the eruption dynamics. Thermal imagery documented in real-time how the effusive fracture propagated at 12:24 GMT of February 27 along the northern rim of the NE crater towards the NE direction. The infrasonic array showed that explosive and degassing activity ceased at 10:32 GMT, a couple of hours before the opening of the effusive fractures. The end of the explosive activity coincided with an intense phase of high-frequency (4-22??Hz) tremor which showed two episodes of harmonic spectrum gliding from 4-7??Hz to {\~{}} 22??Hz. The end of this phase was characterized at 18:26 GMT by a strong infrasonic signal located by the array in the Sciara del Fuoco and associated with the landslide induced by the opening of a lateral effusive vent at 400??m of elevation. This eruption provided a clear example on how the strategy of integrating in near-real-time geophysical information can pinpoint the transition from explosive to effusive activity of the shallow volcanic system at Stromboli. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Our ability to forecast volcanic hazards at active volcanoes stems from our knowledge of parameters affecting eruption dynamics. Persistent activity displayed by basaltic volcanic systems, such as Etna and Stromboli, is governed mainly by the textural evolution and rheological properties of eruptive products. Here, we investigate the high temperature (1131 °C {\textless} T{\textless} 1187 °C) rheological behavior and textural evolution of remelted natural basaltic magmas from Stromboli and Etna volcanic systems upon cooling and crystallization at atmospheric conditions. The pure liquid and subliquidus isothermal viscosities are investigated using a concentric cylinder apparatus by varying strain rate applied to the investigated materials. Detailed textural analysis has been performed in order to evaluate the effect of crystal distribution on the rheological evolution of magmas. At subliquidus conditions, the mineralogical assemblage is dominated by the presence of spinel and plagioclase with the occurrence of stable clinopyroxene only at the lowest temperatures (1157 and 1131 °C for the Stromboli and the Etna samples, respectively). The overall crystal fraction ($\phi$) varies between 0.06 and 0.27. In the high T regime the viscous response to applied stress and strain rate is strongly affected by the presence of even small amounts of crystals. Large discrepancies between measured and predicted viscosities obtained using the Einstein-Roscoe (ER) equation are also found at low crystal fractions. We find here that, at the investigated conditions, the physical effect caused by the presence of elongated crystals is orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by existing models which only account for spherical particles. It also appears that a weak shear thinning behavior occurs at the lowest temperatures investigated. Crystal shape and, with it, the strain-rate dependence of the rheological properties appear to play primary roles in influencing the transport properties of these basaltic magmas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The rate at which basaltic magma is discharged varies substantially during many eruptions. An individual eruption has an eruption rate (Qe), the volumetric rate of discharge averaged over the whole or a major part of an eruption, and an effusion rate (Qf), the volumetric flux rate at any given time. In many examples Qf soon reaches a maximum value after a short period of waxing flow, partly because of magmatic expansion, and then falls more slowly in the later parts of the eruption. The release of elastic strain energy from stored magma and the sub-volcanic reservoir during eruption can produce an exponential form of such waning flow. Comparison of the eruption rates of the historic eruptions of Mauna Loa, Kilauea and Etna shows that for each volcano there is a trend of decreasing Qe with increasing duration of eruption. This relationship is not predicted by a simple elastic model of magma release. Two additional processes are invoked to explain the eruptive histories of these volcanoes: modification of the eruptive conduits, and the continued supply of magma from depth during eruption. Conduits evolving from dikes to plugs by wall-rock erosion or freezing of magma can result in increased early values of Qf and the maintenance of very low values of Qf values for long periods later in the eruption. Discharge variations during three specific eruptions are discussed in detail. Paricutin (1943-1952) had exponentially waning flow, with a time constant of about three years, that is consistent with a deep reservoir. The waning flow of Hekla's 1947-1948 eruption showed some of the characteristics of conduit modification, whilst the 1959 Kilauea Iki eruption is interpreted in terms of a closed system with varying magma rheology. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Field relations, petrography, bulk and micro-scale chemistry reveal that the most recent history of hazardous Changbaishan-Tianchi volcano should be revised with important implications for volcanic hazard in NE Asia. Currently, the two most recent large eruptions are identified separately as a VEI 5 trachytic Baguamiao eruption (BGM) and the much heralded VEI 7, late 946 CE (Common Era) “Millennium” eruption (ME) of comendite. However, we find that the former is part of the latter based on the following evidence: (1) trachytic fallout of the BGM lies directly on the comendite tephra of the ME without any indication of depositional hiatus; (2) abundant mingled trachyte-comendite pumice in the tephra deposits; (3) similar chemistry of mingled pumice and its components to those in the BGM and ME products; (4) correlation of bimodal glass shard compositions in the distal ‘B-Tm' ash from the Japan Sea with comendite and trachyte glass from the BGM and ME products. Based on the above evidence, we suggest that the great Millennium eruption of 946 CE should be revised finally to include the BGM trachyte as its final stage. Furthermore, deposits attributed to two other trachytic eruptions in 1668 and/or 1702 CE (also called Baguamiao by some authors), and 1903 CE referred to in historic accounts were also examined. Our field observations, petrography, bulk and micro-scale chemistry combined with previously published Ra/Th ages indicate that all these trachytes are either primary deposits of the ME or its reworked deposits. Thus our findings do not support two separate post-ME eruptions and require that volcanic hazard assessment at Changbaishan volcano include this new interpretation. Recently published geochronological data integrated with our new petrochemical and volcanological framework informs the magma dynamics leading to the ME. The ME comendite, derived from a parental trachyte similar to the BGM started accumulating at shallow levels around 12 ka to 8 ka. Around 4 to 1.6 ka the BGM trachyte sensu strictu separated from its basaltic parent and started accumulating and crystallizing separately from the ME comendite. Just prior to the ME eruption, mingling of trace amounts of a third more mafic hybrid is implicated by the composition of mafic glass selvedges. The strong evidence for mixing of all these endmembers in the eruption products suggests that recharge mixing and overturn of this predominantly comendite-trachyte system occurred during the {\~{}} 1 ka ME. The common occurrence of comendite and trachyte in the last 100 ka (also maybe 1 Ma) at Changbaishan-Tianchi suggests that conditions for trachyte-comendite magma interactions are prevalent in the magma system of Changbaishan and maybe crucial in catastrophic eruptions there.},

We estimated and tracked the source locations of volcanic tremor associated with the eruption at high temporal resolution, using a method based on the spatial distribution of tremor amplitudes. Although the tremor source locations were not well constrained in depth, their epicenters were well located beneath the erupted crater and the summit. Tremor sources were seen to descend approximately 2 km over a period of several minutes prior to the beginning of the eruption. Detailed analysis of the time series of tremor amplitudes suggests that this descent is a robust feature. Our finding may be an important constraint for modeling the 2014 eruption of Ontake volcano as well as for monitoring activities on this and other volcanoes.},

Reducing vulnerability to volcanic eruptions requires a thorough understanding of the processes that govern eruptive activity.

abstract = {Analysis of infrasonic pressure waves generated by active volcanoes is essential to the understanding of volcanic explosion dynamics. Unlike seismic waves propagating in the earth, infrasonic airwaves offer a relatively unfiltered representation of source motions at the vent during an eruption. Time-varying acoustic propagation filters caused by changeable atmospheric conditions are minimal for microphones deployed at intermediate distances ({\textless} 5 km from the vent). Thus the recorded excess pressure time series directly reflects the impulsivity of the degassing source at the vent. In the most simple experiments, infrasound monitoring is valuable for differentiation of subsurface seismicity from the seismicity associated with an eruption. In other instances, infrasound monitoring may be used in conjunction with seismic monitoring to understand the style of eruption and information about the physical source processes and source location. This manuscript is an introductory overview of the generation and propagation of volcanic infrasound. An analysis of infrasonic records generated from five volcanic case studies is provided in an accompanying article [Johnson et al., J. Volcanol. Geotherm.

abstract = {We used 12 high-temperature deformation experiments on fabricated cores of rhyolite ash to explore the effect of porosity on the rheology of pyroclastic deposits. During deformation, the cores of ash accommodate strain mainly by shortening and reduction of porosity. Porosity loss creates a strain-dependent rheology expressed by a marked and continuous increase in effective viscosity. The effective viscosity () of pyroclastic materials is predicted as a function of porosity () and melt viscosity () by: .$\backslash$nThe optimal value for the parameter $\alpha$, based on the experimental data, is 0.78 ± 0.15. These experiments provide constraints on the time scales of compaction and flow processes in volcanic systems under variable conditions (i.e., temperature, load stress). Our results indicate that welding and compaction processes in pyroclastic deposits (e.g., ignimbrites, conduits) can occur on time scales of tens of minutes to hours. At these time scales, welding is fully decoupled from cooling of the deposits and may be coupled to depositional processes. Within volcanic conduits, welding processes operate on fragmented magma rapidly enough to eliminate porosity in a matter of hours, thereby sealing off permeability and supporting cyclical Vulcanian-style explosive eruptions.},

abstract = {Online Material: Figures showing normalized onset peak pressure and energy across the Sakurajima network.Great diversity has been observed in volcanic infrasound signals worldwide, reflecting rich variability in their physical source mechanisms. Infrasound waveforms, estimated signal powers, and frequency contents vary dramatically across a large spectrum of physical eruptive styles (e.g., Johnson and Ripepe, 2011; Fee and Matoza, 2013; Garces et al., 2013). The observed infrasound signals and eruptive styles span, but do not fall neatly into, the idealized terms such as Hawaiian, Strombolian, Vulcanian, sub‐Plinian, and Plinian (e.g., Walker, 1973; Fee and Matoza, 2013). In physical volcanology, the description and classification of explosive eruption styles are traditionally based on metrics of the thickness, areal extent, and grain size distributions of eruptive products (Walker, 1973). However, eruptive products represent time‐integrated end results of the fragmentation, ejection, and dispersal processes, and the idealized terms do not adequately capture the observed diversity in explosion styles. Infrasound data, which represent a geophysical recording of the explosion process, show promise for better characterizing, quantifying, and classifying the many varied mechanisms and styles of explosive eruptions (e.g., Johnson, 2007; Sahetapy‐Engel et al., 2008; Marchetti et al., 2009; Lopez et al., 2013).Previous conceptual understanding of acoustic signals from explosive eruptions has tended to focus on two end‐member signal durations: (1) discrete explosion (blast) waves with relatively simple waveforms lasting from several to tens of seconds (e.g., Firstov and Kravchenko, 1996; Ripepe and Marchetti, 2002; Johnson, 2003; Marchetti et al., 2009, 2013) and (2) sustained, broadband, infrasonic tremor signals lasting from minutes to hours (e.g., Vergniolle and Caplan‐Auerbach, 2006; Matoza et al., 2009; Fee, Steffke, {\ldots}},

abstract = {Frequent degassing explosions, occurring at intervals of minutes to tens of minutes, are common at many active basaltic and andesitic volcanoes worldwide. In August 1997, April 1998, and September 1998 we recorded seismic and acoustic signals generated at two andesitic volcanoes with 'Strombolian-type' activity. Despite variations in explosion frequency (5-15 h-1at Karymsky as opposed to 1-3 h-1at Sangay), the signatures of the explosions are remarkably similar at these two, diverse field sites. In all explosions, gas emission begins rapidly and is correlated with an impulsive acoustic pressure pulse. Seismic waveforms are emergent and begin 1-2 s before the explosion. We classify explosion events at the two volcanoes as either short-duration (less than 1 min) simple impulses or long-duration (up to 5 min) tremor events. Many tremor events have harmonic frequency spectra and correspond to regular 1 s acoustic pulses, often audible, that sound like chugging from a locomotive. Chugging events are intermittent, suggesting that the geometry or geochemistry of the process is variable over short time scales. We attribute the 1 Hz periodic chugs to a resonant phenomenon in the upper section of the conduit. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A shallow explosion in a fluid is one of the fundamental processes of airwave generation in volcanic eruptions. To better understand the mechanism of the airwave generation, underwater explosion experiments were conducted. Although the underwater explosions have been intensely studied over the last century, airwaves have received little attention. In this study, pressure waves were measured in air and under water, and the corresponding motion of the water surface was captured by a high-speed video camera. Airwaves and associated styles of the surface motion show similarities determined by the scaled depth, defined as the depth divided by the cubic root of the explosion energy. The air waveforms are quite different from the pressure waves measured in the water and cannot be completely explained by linear transmission of pressure waves from water to air. The mechanism of airwave generation is a combination of wave transmission and dynamics of the interface boundary. The first mechanism directly reflects the explosion source, and the same source is also observed as the underwater pressure waves. On the other hand, the second is not necessarily visible in the underwater pressure waves but will provide information on the mechanical properties and behavior of the material above the explosion source. Each mechanism is analyzed in the experiments.},

We discuss similarities and differences between hybrid earthquakes and long-period events, and their role in explosions and rockfall events. These events occur usually in swarms, and occasionally merge into tremor, an observation that can shed further light on the generation and composition of harmonic tremor. We use a 2D finite difference method to model major features of low-frequency seismic signatures and compare them with the observations. A depth-dependent velocity model for a fluid-filled conduit is introduced which accounts for the varying gas-content in the magma, and the impact on the seismic signals is discussed. We carefully analyse episodes of tremor that show shifting spectral lines and model those in terms of changes in the gas content of the magma as well as in terms of a time-dependent triggering mechanism of low-frequency resonances. In this way we explain the simultaneous occurrence of low-frequency events and tremor with a spectral content comprising integer harmonics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The crestal portion of the upper-crustal Wallowa batholith, northeastern Oregon, provides an exceptional three-dimensional section through a flat batholith roof which rolls over into a steep wall at elevations of about 1600-2800. m. The roof-batholith margin is interpreted as representing the 'frozen-in' process zone of granodiorite magma which was arrested during its ascent, thus providing a direct view into processes that operate during construction of large, shallow-level Cordilleran-type batholiths. The batholith host rock records two principal and presumably coeval emplacement processes: ductile flow largely accommodated by rheologically weak and thus severely deformed marbles in the steep wall, and voluminous stoping of rheologically stronger, bedded siliciclastic rocks along the flat roof. Structures preserved along the roof suggest that the stoping was a multi-stage process involving emplacement of up to hundred meters long sills along bedding planes and formation of short connecting dikes cutting across bedding to produce sill-dike networks along the batholith-roof contact. Portions of the sill-dike networks and enclosed large rectangular roof blocks were then stoped into and continued to be mechanically disintegrated in the magma chamber. This inferred mechanism departs from the commonly assumed mode of stoped block formation solely by thermal shattering. In our view, host rocks in the process zone are fractured by dike propagation. It follows that such process of roof disruption and subsequent block stoping could be extremely rapid. In combination with other processes (e.g., roof uplift, ductile flow in weak lithologies), such rapid stoping could contribute to emplacement of voluminous and mostly non-sheeted Cordilleran-type batholiths at upper crustal levels. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The effects of topography and atmospheric structures on infrasonic wave propagation from a volcanic source were investigated using observations and numerical modeling. This paper presents the first long-term observational data set showing spatiotemporal variations in patterns of infrasound propagation at distances of up to 60 km from a persistently active infrasound source (Sakurajima Volcano, Japan). The data show that the amplitudes of infrasonic waves received at distant stations relative to those received at a reference station close to the source can vary up to an order of magnitude over short time intervals and short distances and that they do not follow the theoretical geometric decay expected for homogeneous media. Moreover, waveforms also change significantly in both time and space. Numerical simulations were performed using a two-dimensional finite difference time domain (2-D FDTD) method. Effects of atmospheric structure and topography are included in a vertical section parallel to the wave propagation direction. The simulation successfully reproduced the variations of amplitudes and waveforms. Results are interpreted in terms of wave refraction due to sound and wind speed gradients and wave diffraction at topographic barriers. Our numerical results indicate that both atmospheric and topographic propagation effects are nonnegligible. To evaluate the propagation effects and determine source processes in spatially and temporally varying infrasound data, atmospheric data with a time resolution higher than is currently available are required. If the data are available, the present results suggest that the propagation effects could be evaluated using 2-D FDTD modeling at realistic calculation times.},

abstract = {The source mechanism of Strombolian explosions at Mt. Yasur, Vanuatu, is analyzed using a unique data set which enables us to combine different methodologies. The novelty of the approach presented here lies in the combination of seismic, acoustic and Doppler-radar data. Thus, using infrasound and Doppler radar observations we are able to provide independent estimates of the volume of the eruptive source. In the following, we show that a correlation exists between source volume and the maximum particle velocity of the expelled volcanic products. In order to determine the source location and the associated mechanism and to compare those two methods, we use time reversal imaging and moment tensor inversion. While the first method also applies to extended sources, the latter might be biased by its intrinsic point source approximation. We show that time reversal imaging can deliver an estimate of the source depth without any a priori assumptions even in an unfavorable scenario in terms of topography and receiver setup. The inverted source mechanism retrieved from moment tensor inversion is found to be largely isotropic, with minor deviatoric components. The inverted source location points towards an area to the north-west of the active craters, indicative of a common feeder system of the activity at Mt. Yasur. However, it is also evident, that to fully locate the source of Strombolian activity at Yasur location precision must be enhanced. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Low-frequency volcanic earthquakes are indicators of magma transport and activity within shallow conduit systems. At a number of volcanoes, these events exhibit a high degree of waveform similarity providing a criterion for classification. Using cross-correlation techniques to quantify the degree of similarity, we develop a method to sort events into families containing comparable waveforms. Events within a family have been triggered within one small source volume from which the seismic wave has then travelled along an identical path to the receiver. This method was applied to a series of 16 low-frequency earthquake swarms, well correlated with cyclic deformation recorded by tiltmeters, at Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills Volcano, Montserrat, in June 1997. Nine waveform groups were identified containing more than 45 events each. The families are repeated across swarms with only small changes in waveform, indicating that the seismic source location is stable with time. The low-frequency seismic swarms begin prior to the point at which inflation starts to decelerate, suggesting that the seismicity indicates or even initiates a depressurisation process. A major dome collapse occurred within the time window considered, removing the top 100 m of the dome. This event caused activity within some families to pause for several cycles before reappearing. This shows that the collapse did not permanently disrupt the source mechanism or the path of the seismic waves.},

abstract = {The flow dynamics of magmas is controlled by several parameters, including magma rheology, density, surface tension, gas and liquid flow rate, and the geometry of the flow field, which is mainly regulated by the conduit shape. For this reason, magmatic flows along fis-sures and dikes are significantly different from those along axisymmetric conduits. Basaltic eruptions are typically fed by fractures or dike systems that reach the surface, giving rise to fissure eruptions. Scaled experiments show that in these low-viscosity systems, gas transport and segregation (i.e., the outgassing dynamics) are deeply controlled by the fracture geometry. Rapid bubble clustering and formation of bubble plumes determine the formation of lateral magma convection cells involving up to 70 vol{\%} of the melt. In analogy with outgassing in cylindrical conduits, the average vesicularity and size of bubbles increase with increasing gas flow rate and melt viscosity and density, which also control the lateral extent of the bubble plume and convection cells.},

abstract = {The transient dynamics of magma ascent during dome-forming eruptions were investigated and the effects of magma chamber pressure perturbations on eruption rate are illustrated. The numerical model DOMEFLOW, developed by the authors for this work, is applied to the problem. DOMEFLOW is a transient 1.5D isothermal two-phase flow model of magma ascent through an axisymmetric conduit of variable radius, which accounts for gas exsolution, bubble growth, crystallization induced by degassing, permeable gas loss through overlying magma and through conduit walls, as well as viscosity changes due to crystallization and degassing. For runs in which chamber pressure increases, the time required to reach the new steady state (transition time) is a complex function of the pressure perturbation, while for decreasing chamber pressure, transition time is a monotonic function of the magnitude of the pressure perturbation. The transition to the new steady state is mainly controlled by magma compressibility, travel time (time required for one parcel of magma to travel from chamber to surface), and the time over which the pressure perturbation occurs. Results of many runs ({\textgreater} 300) were analyzed using dimensional analysis to reveal a general relationship which predicts the temporal evolution of magma effusion rate for a given sudden increase in chamber pressure; the product of the change in steady-state extrusion rate and the time required to reach the new steady state is linearly proportional to the normalized change in chamber pressure, the volume of the conduit, and the ratio of top and bottom conduit radii, and inversely proportional to the cubic root of volatile fraction. This relationship is used to interpret observed variations in two ongoing dome-building eruptions, the Soufri??re Hills volcano, Montserrat, and Merapi volcano, Indonesia. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The paper describes an investigation of a subjectively distinguishable element of high speed jet noise known as ‘crackle'. ‘Crackle' cannot be characterized by the normal spectral description of noise. It is shown to be due to intense spasmodic short-duration compressive elements of the wave form. These elements have low energy spread over a wide frequency range. The crackling of a large jet engine is caused by groups of sharp compressions in association with gradual expansions. The groups occur at random and persist for some 10-1 8, each group containing about 10 compressions, typically of strength 5 x 10W atmos at a distance of 50 m. The skewness of the amplitude probability distri- bution of the recorded sound quantifies crackle, though the recording process probably changes the skewness level. Skewness values in excess of unity have been measured; noises with skewness less than 0.3 seem to be crackle free. Crackle is uninfluenced by the jet scale, but varies strongly with jet velocity and angular position. The jet temperature does not affect crackle, neither does combustion. Supersonic jets crackle strongly whether or not they are ideally expanded through convergent-divergent nozzles. Crackle is formed (we think) because of local shock formation due to nonlinear wave steepening at the source and not from long-term nonlinear propagation. Such long-term effects are important in flight, where they are additive. Some jet noise suppressors inhibit crackle},

abstract = {Laboratory flows, self-capped by high-viscosity fluid, exhibit vertical pressure gradients similar to those postulated within conduits feeding dome-building eruptions. Overpressure and pressure cycles exhibited at laboratory scale provide insight into the mechanism of tilt cycles at volcanic scale. Experimental pressure cycles correlated with the rate of gas escape, with pressure rise being controlled by diffusion of volatile into bubbles during times when gas escape from the flow was negligible. The increase in pressure continued until margin decrepitation created preferential pathways for rapid gas escape from permeable foam, thereby reducing pressure within the flow. As pressure reduced, the gas escape pathways sealed and diffusion repressurized the system. This implies that tilt cycles, such as those exhibited by the Soufrie`re Hills Volcano, Montserrat, result from a diffusively pumped process that oscillates around the viscous-elastic transition within the outer regions of the flow. Phases of open- and closedsystem degassing result, with gas escaping through fractures created and maintained by the flow process itself. Fluid-dynamically, this mechanism generates an oscillation between Poiseuille flow and plug flow, with a 1-D model of plug motion giving a reasonable representation of observation in both experimental and volcanic cases.},

abstract = {The potential of hydrothermal boiling in groundwater flow channels for generating harmonic tremor (a relatively monochromatic ground vibration associated with volcanic activity) is examined. We use simple {\&}{\#}8220;organ pipe{\&}{\#}8221; theory of normal-mode fluid vibration and fundamental energy considerations to develop a first-order analytical model of a hydrothermal-boiling source of harmonic tremor. We use this model to estimate order-of-magnitude groundwater flow channel lengths and boiling heat transfer rates required to produce harmonic tremor with dominant frequencies in the range 0.5{\&}{\#}8211;5 Hz and surface wave reduced displacements of up to 100 cm2. Depending on groundwater sound speed, flow channel lengths of the order of 1{\&}{\#}8211;1000 m are required to produce fluid vibration eigenfrequencies in the range 0.5{\&}{\#}8211;5 Hz. The boiling heat transfer rate required to produce tremor with a given surface wave reduced displacement depends on the tremor frequency and on whether saturated boiling or subcooled boiling is the cause of the tremor. Saturated boiling produces groundwater vibration via steam bubble growth, whereas subcooled boiling produces groundwater vibration via steam bubble collapse. We find that subcooled hydrothermal boiling is from 102 to 104 times more efficient than saturated boiling in converting boiling {\&}{\#}8220;thermal{\&}{\#}8221; power to seismic power. For example, the boiling heat transfer rates required to produce 1-Hz tremor with reduced displacements of up to 100 cm2 via subcooled boiling are generally less than a few thousand megawatts; for saturated boiling, the required boiling heat transfer rates are several orders of magnitude larger than this. The highest values of heat flow reported in the literature for volcanic crater lakes and terrestrial and ocean floor geothermal areas are of the order of 1000 MW. Taking this value as a first-order estimate of an upper limit on possible boiling heat transfer rates in volcanic hydrothermal systems, our results suggest that saturated hydrothermal boiling is capable of generating only low-amplitude harmonic tremor, with surface wave reduced displacements no higher than a few square centimeters. However, subcooled hydrothermal boiling could potentially generate high-amplitude harmonic tremor, with reduced displacements as large as several hundred square centimeters. As a specific application of our model, we evaluate the potential of hydrothermal boiling for generating harmonic tremor at recently active Mount St. Helens and Nevado Del Ruiz volcanoes. We conclude that subcooled boiling likely could have produced the tremor episodes considered at both volcanoes. Saturated boiling also could explain the Nevado Del Ruiz tremor but probably not the more powerful Mount St. Helens tremor.},

abstract = {ROV investigation of hydrothermal fluids issuing from vents on the floor of Yellowstone lake revealed temperatures in excess of 170 °C — the highest temperature yet reported for vent fluids within Yellowstone National Park (YNP). The study site is east of Stevenson Island at depth of approximately 100–125 m. In-situ pH and redox measurements of vent fluids were made using solid state sensors designed to sustain the elevated temperatures and pressures. YSZ membrane electrode with Ag/Ag2O internal element and internal pressure balanced Ag/AgCl reference electrode were used to measure pH, while a platinum electrode provided redox constraints. Lab verification of the pH sensor confirmed excellent agreement with Nernst law predictions, especially at temperatures in excess of 120 °C. In-situ pH values of between 4.2 and 4.5 were measured for the vent fluids at temperatures of 120 to 150 °C. The slightly acidic vent fluids are likely caused by CO2 enrichment in association with magmatic degassing effects that occur throughout YNP. This is consistent with results of simple model calculations and direct observation of CO2 bubbles in the immediate vicinity of the lake floor vents. Simultaneous redox measurements indicated moderate to highly reducing conditions (− 0.2 to − 0.3 V). As typical of measurements of this kind, internal and external redox disequilibria likely preclude unambiguous determination of redox controlling reactions. Redox disequilibria, however, can be expected to drive microbial metabolism and diversity in the near vent environment. Thus, the combination of in-situ pH and redox sensor deployments may ultimately provide the requisite framework to better understand the microbiology of the newly discovered hot vents on Yellowstone lake floor.},

abstract = {The fragmentation of bubbly magma is a defining point in a volcanic eruption-before fragmentation the magma flows relatively slowly, during fragmentation the bubbles break up to release compressed gas and, afterwards, the eruption becomes a violent gas flow carrying suspended magma particles. Seemingly benign lava flows or domes can suddenly fragment into deadly pyroclastic flows(1-3). Several criteria have been proposed to define the point of magma fragmentation or foam stability(4-7). The criterion of Papale(7) is based on melt relaxation theory and equates magma strain rate with the rate of increase of flow velocity with distance. It ignores, however, the role of bubble pressure in causing fragmentation. Two empirical approaches(4,5) consider the role of high bubble pressure in causing fragmentation but do not address the underlying physics of magma fragmentation. Here I develop a fragmentation criterion for bubbly magma based on brittle failure theory and apply it to the fragmentation of lava domes and flows. On the basis of this theory, a bubbly magma will fragment when the tensile stress at the inner walls of bubbles exceeds the tensile strength of the magma. The fragmentation conditions depend strongly on initial water content, with calculated vesicularity and final water levels coinciding reasonably well with those in observed pumices. This suggests that the proposed criterion captures the essence of the fragmentation process in bubbly magma.},

In these eruption styles, the violent release of relatively large volumes of magma decoupled from the melt ejects coarse, still molten pyroclasts. Strombolian eruptions involve the complex bursting of gas pockets at the volcanic vent, while Hawaiian eruptions are best described as the fountaining of sustained jets of gas and fluidal pyroclasts. Transitions between these two styles and their variations are linked to the amount and chemical composition of the magmatic gases that drive the eruptions and to the way gas pockets segregate from the magma and migrate along the volcanic conduit, also a function of magma physical properties and conduit geometry. Each style is also characterized by a specific infrasonic signature, which can be used to measure the gas pockets and deduce their origin and evolution.},

abstract = {A porous flow model for magma migration from a deep source within a volcanic edifice is developed. The model is based on the assumption that an isotropic and homogeneous system of fractures allows magma migration from a common localized source to the surface of the volcano. The evolution of the free surface of magma (i.e. the locus where magma pressure equals the atmospheric pressure) is reproduced through a first-order perturbation approach to the non-linear equations governing the migration of incompressible fluids through a porous medium. It is argued that flank eruptions should preferably concentrate in those regions where the topography is lower than the theoretical free surface of magma, since, in this case, less pressure is necessary at the source to accomplish magma migration to the surface against gravity and viscous friction. Comparisons of the theoretical free surface with several topographical sections of Mt. Etna, where eruptive fractures and vents preferably concentrate, seem to confirm the assumption. Even if the model does not pretend to reproduce the topographic surface, the comparison is excellent along the southern and southeastern sections of Mt. Etna, where flank eruption take place over the widest range of altitudes; in this sector, modulations in the eruption site density correlate well with even minor differences between free surface and topography. Along other sections of Mt. Etna, the free surface and the topography are not always in close agreement, but the density of eruption vents generally concentrates in regions where the topography is lower than the free surface, the only notable exception being the northeastern rift. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Izalco volcano is a young parasitic cone located 4 km south and seaward from the central crater of Santa Ana volcano, a mature composite cone. At equal SiO2 contents Izalco's lavas have lower large ion lithophile element (LILE) contents than Santa Ana's lavas, but the compositions of Izalco's lavas have converged toward those of Santa Ana with time, possibly by open-system fractionation. Short-term fluctuations in the SiO2 content of lavas at Izalco are closely related to the level of preceding activity; the higher the level of preceding activity, the lower the SiO2 content. A stratigraphic section of lavas from the Santa Ana crater appears to be an inverted magma chamber with a zoned silicic top and a uniform basaltic base. These observations suggest that graded silicic zones are regularly developed at the top of the basaltic magma bodies feeding this volcanic center. Nearly contemporaneous eruptions of distinctly different magma types (1770-1965 at Izalco, 1904, at Santa Ana and 1722 at San Marcellino) suggests the presence of three different magma bodies beneath the Santa Ana complex, a LILE-poor mafic magma body beneath Izalco; a LILE-rich mafic magma body beneath Santa Ana and a rhyolitic magma beneath the Coatepeque caldera, located on the northeast flank of Santa Ana. ?? 1981.},

abstract = {Jet noise research was initiated by Sir James Lighthill in 1952. Since that time, the development of jet noise theory has followed a very tortuous path. This is, perhaps, not surprising for the understanding of jet noise is inherently tied to the understanding of turbulence in jet flows. Even now, our understanding of turbulence is still tenuous. In the fifties, turbulence was regarded as consisting of a random assortment of small eddies. As a result, the primary focus of jet noise research was to quantify the noise from fine-scale turbulence. This line of work persisted into the eighties. The discovery of large turbulence structures in free shear flows in the early seventies led some investigators to begin questioning the validity of the then established theories. Some went further to suggest that, for high-speed jets, it was the large turbulence structures/instability waves of the flow that were responsible for the dominant part of jet mixing noise. Development of a quantitative theory of noise from large turbulence structures/instability waves took place during the next 15 years. Precision instrumentation and facilities for jet noise measurements became available in the mid-eighties. This permitted a large bank of high-quality narrow band jet noise data to be gathered over the subsequent years. Recent analysis of these data has provided irrefutable evidence that jet noise, in fact, is made up of two basic components; one from the large turbulence structures/instability waves, the other from the fine-scale turbulence. This is true even for subsonic jets. In this paper, some of the crucial research results of the past 44 years, that form the basis of our present understanding of jet noise generation and propagation, are discussed.},

abstract = {Emission of volcanic gas is thought to be the dominant process by which volatiles transit from the deep earth to the atmosphere. Volcanic gas emissions, remain poorly constrained, and volcanoes of Peru are entirely absent from the current global dataset. In Peru, Sabancaya and Ubinas volcanoes are by far the largest sources of volcanic gas. Here, we report the first measurements of the compositions and fluxes of volcanic gases emitted from these volcanoes. The measurements were acquired in November 2015. We determined an average SO2 flux of 15.3 ± 2.3 kg s− 1 (1325-ton day− 1) at Sabancaya and of 11.4 ± 3.9 kg s− 1 (988-ton day− 1) at Ubinas using scanning ultraviolet spectroscopy and dual UV camera systems. In-situ Multi-GAS analyses yield molar proportions of H2O, CO2, SO2, H2S and H2 gases of 73, 15, 10 1.15 and 0.15 mol{\%} at Sabancaya and of 96, 2.2, 1.2 and 0.05 mol{\%} for H2O, CO2, SO2 and H2S at Ubinas. Together, these data imply cumulative fluxes for both volcanoes of 282, 30, 27, 1.2 and 0.01 kg s− 1 of H2O, CO2, SO2, H2S and H2 respectively. Sabancaya and Ubinas volcanoes together contribute about 60{\%} of the total CO2 emissions from the Central Volcanic zone, and dominate by far the total revised volatile budget of the entire Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes.},

abstract = {Eruptions at active silicic volcanoes are often cyclical. For example, at the Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills volcano in Montserrat, Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, and Sakurajima in Japan, episodes of intense activity alternate with repose intervals over periods between several hours and a day. Abrupt changes in eruption rates have been explained with the motion of a plug of magma that alternatively sticks or slides along the wall of the volcanic conduit. However, it is unclear how the static friction that prevents the plug from sliding is periodically overcome. Here we use two-phase flow equations to model a gas-rich, viscous magma ascending through a volcanic conduit. Our analyses indicate that magma compaction yields ascending waves comprised of low- and high-porosity bands. However, magma ascent to lower pressures also causes gas expansion. We find that the competition between magma compaction and gas expansion naturally selects pressurized gas waves with specific periods. At the surface, these waves can induce cyclical eruptive behaviour with periods between 1 and 100 hours, which compares well to the observations from Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills, Mount Pinatubo and Sakurajima. We find that the period is insensitive to volcano structure, but increases weakly with magma viscosity. We conclude that observations of a shift to a longer eruption cycle imply an increase in magma viscosity and thereby enhanced volcanic hazard.},

abstract = {The April 1906 effusive and explosive paroxysm of Vesuvius concluded a 34-year-long cycle, characterized by prevalent effusive activity. The eruption began on 4 April 1906 with limited summit explosions that preceded the lava effusion from vents between 1200 and 600 m a.s.l. on the southern flank of the cone. In the late evening of April 7 the explosive strombolian activity evolved to the paroxysmal phase with the formation of two-km-high lava fountains that continued with varying intensity for about 4 hours. This phase generated a moderately dispersed tephra-fall deposit consisting of strongly vesiculated black scoriae and rare lithic clasts. When the lava fountaining ended, the subterminal effusive activity increased. On 8 April, at 12:37 a.m. a violent earthquake preceded a change in the eruptive style with the ejection of both strongly fragmented, incandescent, vesiculated juvenile material and lithic fragments generated from the violent cone demolition During this phase the eruptive columns progressively drifted toward the north-northeast causing severe damage to the town of Ottaviano. At 4 p.m. another drastic change in the eruptive style occurred, with the formation of a giant sustained gas jet with a low concentration of dense blocky hydrated glass (the intermediate gas phase reported by Perret). This phase was generated by a powerful interaction of phreatic water with a small amount of degassed magma. The paroxysmal eruption ended with a low column generated by the degassing of the hydrothermal system (dark ash phase of Perret). This last episode deposited only a thin ash layer constituted by non-vesiculated ash particles. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The vesiculation of magmas is the most important process which controls eruption style on terrestrial planets and physical and geological characteristics ol volcanoes. This paper, focusing on the evolution ol bubble size distribution, investigates the vesiculation behavior in ascending magmas with constant velocities. Taking into account homogeneous nucleation, growth by diffusion of volatile components, expansion by depressurization, and depletion of volatile components in a silicate melt by progressive vesiculation, the governing equations describing the vesiculation ol magma and the evolution of bubble size distribution are formulated. The behavior of solution is controlled by three nondimensional parameters which represent the nucleation facility (related to the gas/silicate melt interfacial tension), the effective diffusivity (diffusivity divided by ascent velocity) of volatile components in a magma, and the initial saturation pressure. The governing equations are numerically solved for the limited range ol variable parameters. Consequently, the bubble size distribution, the nucleation rate, and the volatile concentration in magma are obtained as functions ol time (depth). The result provides the following qualitative understanding ol the vesiculation process. The nucleation takes place localized in a narrow depth interval. The nucleation depth (pressure) where the nucleation rate reaches a maximum value increases with the nucleation facility and the effective diffusivity and almost linearly increases with the initial saturation pressure. The nucleation interval, the maximum nucleation rate, and the total number of bubbles nucleated decrease with the effective diffusivity. The volatile concentration in magma monotonically decreases with the progressive vesiculation, not by the nucleation of bubbles but by the growth of bubbles nucleated. The depletion factor (the ratio of the volatile concentration in magma at surface to the initial saturation) decreases with the nucleation facility and the effective diffusivity. The quantitative understanding is made by describing moments of the bubble size distribution function, the nucleation depth and interval, the maximum nucleation rate, and the depletion factor as functions of parameters representing an eruption. The results ol numerical solutions are simply interpreted as the single nucleation event and the subsequent growth process using two independent quantities: the total number of bubbles per unit volume and the mean bubble radius. The results are also extrapolated to realistic values of parameters corresponding to the Plinian and sub-Plinian eruptions. Under the condition of a constant depressurization and no interaction among bubbles, the total number ol bubbles per unit volume is strongly reduced with increasing effective diffusivity, and bubbles grow according to the law in which the mean bubble radius is proportional to r2/3, where r represents the effective time of diffusion. These results suggest, through the silica content dependence of the diffusivity ol volatile (water), that a silicic vesiculated rock generally includes a larger number of bubbles than a basic. Quantitative relationships are derived that can be used to determine two eruption parameters from moments ol bubble size distribution function observed in vesiculated rocks quenched at the surface. The shape ol the bubble size distribution function observed in vesiculated rocks is determined by the detail of the growth process ol bubbles, for the case where nucleation takes place at depth, whereas it is determined by the nucleation event for the case where nucleation near the surface is dominant. It is emphasized that derived relationships provide the important basis for estimating eruption parameters such as the nucleation depth or the hypothetical ascent velocity as well as the vesiculation history of erupted magma from the morphological analysis (determination of bubble size distribution) of vesiculated rocks.},

abstract = {The horizontal components of broadband seismographs are highly sensitive to tilt, suggesting that commonly deployed portable broadband seismic sensors may record important tilt information associated with volcanic eruptions. We report on a tilt episode that coincides with the first historical eruption of Anatahan volcano on May 10, 2003. The tilt was recorded by a Strekheisen STS-2 seismograph deployed in an underground insulated chamber 7 km west of the active vent. An ultra-long period signal with a dominant period of several hours was recorded on the E-W component beginning at 06:20 GMT on May 10, which coincides with the onset of continuous volcano-tectonic (VT) seismicity and is one hour prior to the eruption time estimated by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center. The signal is much smaller on the N-S component and absent on the vertical component, suggesting it results from tilt that is approximately radial with respect to the active vent. An estimate of tilt as a function of time is recovered by deconvolving the record to acceleration and dividing by the acceleration of gravity. The record indicates an initial episode of tilt downward away from the volcanic center from 06:20{\&}{\#}8211;09:30 GMT, which we interpret as inflation of the shallow volcanic source. The tilt reverses, recording deflation, from 09:30 until 17:50, after which the tilt signal becomes insignificant. The inflation corresponds to a period of numerous VT events, whereas fewer events were recorded during the deflation episode, and the VT events subsequently resumed after the end of the deflationary tilt. The maximum tilt of 2 microradians can be used to estimate the volume of the source inflation ({\&}{\#}8764;2 million m3), assuming a simple Mogi source model. These calculations are consistent with other estimates of source volume if reasonable source depths are assumed. Examination of broadband records of other eruptions may disclose further previously unrecognized tilt signals.},

The rocks within each series are predominantly related by fractional crystallization. The contents of major and trace elements in the rocks are consistent with their derivation from an enriched upper mantle by variable degrees of partial melting.

abstract = {Bubble nucleation is at the heart of magma ascent and degassing. Nucleation kinetics control how easily a magma exsolves its volatiles, and thereby its explosivity close to the surface. Homogeneous nucleation (i.e. without assistance from crystal substrates or other phases) often requires attainment of large supersaturation pressures ($\delta$P N {\textgreater}100MPa, the change in pressure required for onset of nucleation), while heterogeneous nucleation on pre-existing crystals can occur at significantly lower values ($\delta$P N {\textless}50MPa). Experiments have shown that both nucleation mechanisms are viable in the laboratory. The extent, however, to which one or the other nucleation mechanism dominates in nature is still unresolved. Yet, this distinction is fundamental for applications that employ nucleation theory and its derivatives. The classical nucleation theory allows calculations of nucleation rates in silicate melts, or conversely, yields valuable estimates of supersaturation pressures $\delta$P N given experimental constraints on pressure conditions at the onset of nucleation. Decompression-rate meters (e.g. Toramaru, 2006) also relate the number density of bubbles in pyroclasts - a readily obtained textural characteristic - to rates of pressure change (dP/dt) during ascent. All these treatments require an explicit or implicit decision as to whether magma degassing was dominated by homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation, which is guided by the choice of surface tension values. This contribution exploits the current textural datasets available for eruptions involving a variety of magma compositions to test the assumptions that homogeneous and/or heterogeneous nucleation dominate bubble vesiculation in natural melts. The comparison between pyroclast textures and those obtained via decompression experiments in the laboratory indicates that supersaturation pressures and decompression rates required for homogeneous nucleation are unrealistically high for natural magmas. I review the arguments for and against homogenous nucleation, and defend the alternate view that heterogeneous nucleation may dominate in all magma types, including rhyolites. In order to solve this central debate, our focus needs to be shifted towards understanding the pre-decompression phase equilibria and textural characteristics of magnetite in addition to the state of the melt structure.},

abstract = {Volcanic Risk has been defined as the product: R = Value × Vulnerability × Hazard, where value is the total amount of lives or properties at risk for a volcani eruption, the vulnerability is the percentage of value at risk for a given volcanic event, and the hazard is the probability that a given area may be affected by a certain volcanic phenomenon. We used this definition to evaluate the Risk of loss of human lives for volcanic eruptions of Vesuvius. Value has been determined based on the total number of inhabitants living in areas that could be affected by an eruption. Vulnerability is based on the relative probability of deaths as a result of different volcanic phenomena (tephra fall, pyroclastic flows, etc.). Hazard is evaluated based on the absolute probability of a given phenomenon in a certain area. This last parameter is the most difficult to evaluate. We subdivided the activity of Vesuvius, that produces risk of loss of human lives, into three classes of eruptions, based on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. We assume that the events of each class are distributed according to a poissonian distribution (this is demonstrated for VEI = 3, and inferred for the other classes), so that we can evaluate the absolute probability of an eruption for each class within a given time span. We use a time window of 10 years and evaluate the probabilities of occurrence of at least one eruption for VEI = 3, 4, 5; the probability is respectively: P3 = 0.09896, P4 = 0.01748, P5 = 0.00298. We have made a hazard evaluation for the entire Vesuvian area as well as an evaluation of Volcanic Risk. The obtained map shows that the areas with higher risk are on the southern side of Vesuvius, in the coastal region where each town is characterized by an average Risk of ∼ 1000 inhabitants/10 years. The risk regularly decreases with increasing distance from the volcano. The risk is mostly due to the events with VEI = 3 and 4, as the most destructive effects of VEI = 5 are counterbalanced by the lower probability of such events. The map of volcanic risk is not intended to predict the loss of human lives of an eruption, but to give a methodology that permits to identify those areas where it is necessary to operate in order to reduce the risk of an eruption before it occurs. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The main purpose of the present paper is to present the mathematical expression for the frequency-dependent effective acoustic properties of a liquid-bubble mixture. Effects of the bubble resonance, the heat and mass transfer between the liquid and bubbles, and the viscoelasticity of the liquid are included in the expression. Several characteristic frequencies associated with these internal processes are represented by simple functions of the material and condition parameters. Using these expressions, the acoustic properties of bubbly magmas are calculated and analyzed. It is shown that the dispersion and attenuation of the pressure wave are particularly considerable in the frequency range lower than the characteristic frequency of the mass transfer and in the range near the characteristic frequency of the viscous response of the bubble radius. In the frequency range bounded by these two frequencies, the bubbly magma can be regarded as an elastic medium with the slow sound speed. The significance of such acoustic properties on resonance of a body of bubbly magma is demonstrated in a simple one-dimensional system. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The growth of lava domes can be either quiescent or violent, with transitions between styles of behavior commonly occurring with little warning. Here we propose that the behavior depends on the eruption rate, the magma rheology, and the thickness of the cooling surface. We present a model, based on laboratory simulations, field measurements, and photographic analysis, that relates the morphology and texture of a dome to the thickness of its cooled carapace, and thence to eruption conditions. A sequence of four main types of dome (spiny, lobate, platy, and axisymmetric) is identified in laboratory analog experiments with a Bingham plastic. These regimes are associated with progressively higher effusion rates, lower cooling rates, lower yield strengths, and (in real lava flows) decreasing tendency for explosive decompression during flow front collapse and are ordered according to the value of a single dimensionless number. The model allows an estimate of the yield strengths of the magma forming active domes based on data for the effusion rate and composition. It also permits the eruption rates of prehistoric or extraterrestrial lava domes and flows to be appraised from their morphology, if their compositions can be estimated. A comparison with the laboratory results suggests that the Venusian {\^{a}}€{\oe}pancake domes{\^{a}}€ are likely to have basaltic to basaltic andesitic composition.},

abstract = {Tectonic activity in the Hengill volcanic area in southwestern Iceland accelerated in July 1994, when an unusually persistent swarm of moderate-sized earthquakes began. Although the largest events were magnitude 5, the pattern of upward crustal deformation at 2 cm/yr indicates that most of the activity is related to inflation of a magma chamber at depth. To monitor this activity, we analyze synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites between July 1993 and September 1998 using interferometry. Interferograms composed of images acquired during the snow-free summer months remain coherent on Holocene lava flows, even after 4 years. Some of the interferograms show a discontinuity in the fringe pattern, which we interpret as 8 mm of (aseismic) dip slip on a 3-km-long segment of a N5°E striking normal fault, part of which had been mapped previously. This slip must have occurred between July 31 and September 3, 1995 (inclusive), and has been confirmed by observations in the field. The predominant signature in all the interferograms spanning at least 1 year, however, is a concentric fringe pattern centered just south of the Hromundartindur volcanic center. This we interpret as mostly vertical uplift caused by increasing pressure in an underlying magma source. The volume source that best fits the observed interferograms lies at 7 ± 1 km depth and remains in the same horizontal position to within 2 km. It produces 19 ± 2 mm/yr of uplift. This deformation accumulates as elastic strain energy at a rate 2.8 times the rate of seismic moment release. Accumulated over 5 years, it increases the Coulomb failure stress by {\textgreater} 0.6 bar in an area that includes some 84{\%} of the earthquakes recorded between 1993 and 1998. Under our interpretation, magma is injected at 7 km depth, just below the seismogenic zone formed by colder, brittle rock. There the inflation induces stresses that exceed the Coulomb failure criterion, triggering earthquakes, possibly in a cyclical fashion.},

The accurate correlation of infrasonic waves with video images reveals that: (1) successive impulsive waves and the low-frequency wave ( similar to 0.8Hz) are excited during the collapse of lava blocks falling from the dome, which generates a pyroclastic flow; (2) an impulsive wave is excited by an explosive blowout of the pore-gases which are released by the breakdown of the falling blocks; (3) the low-frequency wave is excited by the volumetric change which results from expansion of the pore-gases released by pulverization of the falling blocks. The comparison between the observed and the synthetic low-frequency waves shows that the amount of volume change is about 2 times that of the initial falling blocks.},

abstract = {Growth of the andesitic lava dome during eruption of Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat involved general increases in discharge rate and dome height with superposed fluctuations on timescales from hours to months. We have modelled magma conduit flow incorporating viscosity variations caused by degassing and crystallization. Gas loss is modelled by permeable flow, with variations of permeability constrained by measurements. Crystallization kinetics is modelled by an Avrami law. Observations and petrological studies constrain conduit diameter (c. 30 m), magma chamber crystal content (c. 60-65{\%}), melt water content (c. 5{\%}), magma temperature (c. 850{\{}degrees{\}}C) and chamber depth (c. 5 km). Gas loss and rheological stiffening cause a maximum in magma overpressure (magma pressure minus lithostatic pressure) at depths of a few hundred metres below the dome. This maximum can explain ground deformation patterns, shallow seismicity, and short-lived Vulcanian explosions. Crystallization kinetics causes a strong feedback mechanism and multiple steady solutions for discharge rate. Small changes in chamber pressure, magma viscosity and conduit diameter strongly amplify discharge rate. Multiple solutions allow cyclic variation of discharge rate. Escalation of activity is attributed principally to influx of hot mafic magma into the chamber, resulting in chamber pressure increasing with time. Dome growth can be intrinsically unpredictable due to non-linear effects.},

abstract = {The 2000 eruptive activity of Miyakejima island began with an earthquake swarm and crustal deformation that was clearly observed by continuous observations of ground tilt and {\{}GPS{\}} on Miyakejima. Based on the crustal deformation data, we estimated the magma migration process at the initial stage (18:30 {\{}LT{\}} on 2000 June 26-06:00 {\{}LT{\}} on 2000 June 27) of the activity. The activity in 2000 has been characterized by a collapse-caldera formation and no fissure eruption on the flank of the island, which is markedly different from the style of the recent eruptions in 1940, 1962 and 1983. We constructed a source model that approximately explains the crustal deformation data. The model consists of four dykes, of which three are intruding dykes and the other is a contracting dyke. We can infer the magma migration process at the initial stage from the model as follows. At 18:30 {\{}LT{\}} on June 26, the magma began to ascend from a dyke-shaped magma chamber and intrude at the southwestern flank of Miyakejima. In the intrusion, the total volume of intruded magma was similar to 4 x 10(6) m(3). At around 21:00 {\{}LT{\}}, a relatively large volume of magma began to intrude as a dyke beneath the west coast of Miyakejima. The dyke then propagated laterally towards the northwest. The amount of magma intruded from 2 1: 00 {\{}LT{\}} to 0 1: 00 {\{}LT{\}} was similar to 40 x 10(6) m(3). This large intrusion caused a discharge of magma from the magma chamber. The northwestward propagation of the dyke and the contraction of the chamber continued thereafter. The discharge of magma from the chamber beneath Miyakejima probably starved the first intrusion that had been ascending towards the southwestern flank of the island, resulting in the collapse-caldera formation after the initial stage. The style of the 2000 eruptive activity relative to recent activity has primarily been changed by the subsurface discharge of magma towards the northwest.},

abstract = {WATER-RICH silicic magmas may erupt explosively, giving rise to massive columns of fragmented ash1-5, or effusively as viscous, bubbly lavas to form lava domes6-8. Complex cycles of explosive and effusive eruptions are often observed8-12. Although these two eruption mechanisms have been modelled independently1,8, the conditions under which a volcano exhibits a particular style of eruption are not known and the transitions between eruption styles are poorly understood. By modelling the ascent of magma along a permeable conduit, we show here that, for small magma-chamber overpressures, the style of eruption - explosive or effusive - is dependent on the magma flow rate. We also identify a critical overpressure above which only explosive eruptions occur. Complex eruption sequences follow naturally. For example, if a shallow magmatic system is supplied with magma at an intermediate flow rate, the eruption will be slow and effusive until the chamber over-pressure becomes too large. An explosive eruption then relieves the overpressure and an effusive eruption style resumes. We suggest that monitoring of temporal variations in chamber overpressure (for example, by measuring ground deformation) can be used to assess whether a passively effusing volcano has the potential to erupt explosively. {\textcopyright} 1994 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Understanding past changes in the Antarctic ice sheets provides insight into how they might respond to future climate warming. During the Pliocene and Pleistocene, geological data show that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet responded to glacial and interglacial cycles by remaining relatively stable in its interior, but oscillating at its marine-based margin. It is currently not clear how outlet glaciers, which connect the ice sheet interior to its margin, responded to these orbitally-paced climate cycles. Here we report new ice surface constraints from Skelton Glacier, an outlet of the East Antarctic ice sheet, which drains into the Ross Ice Shelf. Our multiple-isotope (10Be and26Al) cosmogenic nuclide data indicate that currently ice-free areas adjacent to the glacier underwent substantial periods of exposure and ice cover in the past. We use an exposure-burial model driven by orbitally-paced glacial–interglacial cycles to determine the probable ice surface history implied by our data. This analysis shows that: 1) the glacier surface has likely fluctuated since at least the Pliocene; 2) the ice surface was {\textgreater}200 m higher than today during glacial periods, and the glacier has been thicker than present for ∼75–90{\%} of each glacial–interglacial cycle; and 3) ice cover at higher elevations possibly occurred for a relatively shorter time per Pliocene cycle than Pleistocene cycle. Our multiple-nuclide approach demonstrates the magnitude of ice surface fluctuations during the Pliocene and Pleistocene that are linked to marine-based ice margin variability.},

abstract = {In November 1995, we installed five, three-component broadband seismometers and electronic tiltmeters around the circumference of Arenal Volcano, a young stratovolcano in Costa Rica that exhibits strombolian activity. With the addition of two continuous-recording GPS receivers deployed in May 1995, these instruments provide continuous monitoring of seismicity and ground deformation at an active volcano over a very wide bandwidth. In addition, during April-May 1997, we deployed a small, linear array of co-located three-component seismometers and broadband microphones. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of all the seismic and acoustic data collected thus far. Seismic signals are primarily of two types: (1) long-period (1-3 Hz) transients associated with summit explosions; and (2) harmonic tremor that contains regularly spaced spectral peaks (0.9, 1.8, 2.7, 3.6, 4.5, 5.4, 6.3, and 7.1 Hz) and lasts up to several hours. The explosion signals appear to originate in a small volume that is located at shallow depth beneath the vent and does not migrate with time. No unambiguous long-period seismic signals (T {\textgreater} 5 s)associated with volcanic processes at Arenal have been observed during the three-year deployment period. The spectra of summit explosions show distinct signatures at each site, suggesting significant path and/or site modification of the waveforms. In contrast, the harmonic tremor signals show no variation in the frequency content at the five sites, nor on the three seismic components at each site (Hagerty et al., 1997). This, and the fact that harmonic tremor is recorded in the acoustic channels as well, demonstrates that harmonic tremor is not a seismic propagation effect and that pressure disturbances propagate within the magma-gas mixture inside of volcanic conduits. These pressure waves are sensitive to the flow velocity and to small changes in the gas content of the magma-gas mixture. Observations and synthetic tests are presented that challenge the notion that harmonic tremor is a superposition of repeated gas explosions at shallow depth. We propose that equilibrium degassing of the melt creates a stable, stratified magma column where the void fraction increases with decreasing depth and that disruption of this equilibrium stratification is responsible for observed variations in the seismic efficiency of explosions.

Understanding volcanic jets is critical for determining eruption column dynamics and mitigating volcanic hazards; however, volcanic jets are inherently difficult to observe due to their violence and opacity. Infrasound from the 2011 eruption of Nabro Volcano, Eritrea has waveform features highly similar to the “crackle” phenomenon uniquely produced by man-made supersonic jet engines and rockets and is characterized by repeated asymmetric compressions followed by weaker, gradual rarefactions. This infrasonic crackle indicates that infrasound source mechanisms in sustained volcanic eruptions are strikingly similar to jet noise sources from heated, supersonic jet engines and rockets, suggesting that volcanologists can utilize the modeling and physical understandings of man-made jets to understand volcanic jets. The unique, distinctive infrasonic crackle from Nabro highlights the use of infrasound to remotely detect and characterize hazardous eruptions and its potential to determine volcanic jet parameters.},

abstract = {Pyroclastic deposits interpreted as subaqueous ash-flow tuff have been recognized within Archean to Recent marine and lacustrine sequences. Several authors proposed a high-temperature emplacement for some of these tuffs. However, the subaqueous welding of pyroclastic deposits remains controversial. The Visean marine volcaniclastic formations of southern Vosges (France) contain several layers of rhyolitic and rhyodacitic ash-flow tuff. These deposits include, from proximal to distal settings, breccia, lapilli and fine-ash tuff. The breccia and lapilli tuff are partly welded, as indicated by the presence of fiamme, fluidal and axiolitic structures. The lapilli tuff form idealized sections with a lower, coarse and welded unit and an upper, bedded and unwelded fine-ash tuff. Sedimentary structures suggest that the fine-ash tuff units were deposited by turbidity currents. Welded breccias, interbedded in a thick submarine volcanic complex, indicate the close proximity of the volcanic source. The lapilli and fine-ash tuff are interbedded in a thick marine sequence composed of alternating sandstones and shales. Presence of a marine stenohaline fauna and sedimentary structures attest to a marine depositional environment below storm-wave base. In northern Anatolia, thick massive sequences of rhyodacitic crystal tuff are interbedded with the Upper Cretaceous marine turbidites of the Mudurnu basin. Some of these tuffs are welded. As in southern Vosges, partial welding is attested by the presence of fiamme and fluidal structures. The latter are frequent in the fresh vitric matrix. These tuff units contain a high proportion of vitroclasis, and were emplaced by ash flows. Welded tuff units are associated with non-welded crystal tuff, and contain abundant bioclasts which indicate mixing with water during flowage. At the base, basaltic breccia beds are associated with micritic beds containing a marine fauna. The welded and non-welded tuff sequences are interbedded in an alternation of limestones and marls. These limestones are rich in pelagic microfossils. The evidence above strongly suggest that in both examples, tuff beds are partly welded and were emplaced at high temperature by subaqueous ash flows in a permanent marine environment. The sources of the pyroclastic material are unknown in both cases. We propose that the ash flows were produced during submarine fissure eruptions. Such eruptions could produce non-turbulent flows which were insulated by a steam carapace before deposition and welding. The welded ash-flow tuff deposits of southern Vosges and northern Anatolia give strong evidence for existence of subaqueous welding. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {We have used a combination of field studies, laboratory analog experiments and computational fluid dynamics to determine the factors controlling the deformation and agglutination of spatter. Our field studies identify a spectrum of clast types produced by fire-fountains, ranging from brittle scoria through to fluidal droplets that coalesce. The clast types are related to conditions in the parent fire-fountain. There are a number of different outcomes for a clast impacting the ground, ranging from brittle fracture, through folding to fluidal splashing. Laboratory analog experiments and computational fluid dynamics were used to quantify both the outcome and the type of deformation experienced by viscous clasts impacting the ground. We find that a clast will splash on hitting the ground, forming daughter droplets, if its impact Reynolds number is greater than ca. 80. This condition is readily met for clasts of at least 10 cm diameter, falling at terminal speed, if the magma viscosity is up to 105 Pa s. Splashing is predicted to be a common process during deposition of inner-fountain clasts and therefore to play an important role in agglutination of near-vent spatter deposits. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Explosive volcanism such as the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo, Philippines, and the 2008 Mt. Chait{\'{e}}n, Chile, eruptions is caused by violent vesiculation of hydrous magma. However, gas may efficiently separate from magma owing to the enhancement of gas permeability by shear deformation of magma flowing in a volcanic conduit. This makes it difficult to maintain the driving force of explosive volcanism although explosive volcanism is actually common. Here, we propose that shear localization in a volcanic conduit controls the eruption style and explosivity based on deformation experiments of vesicular magma linked with synchrotron radiation X-ray radiography and computed tomography. We observed, for the first time in situ, that the shear localization caused magma fracturing and formed a slip plane, and thus inhibited deformation and outgassing elsewhere. We also observed the compaction of vesicular magma into a dense "lava" as a result of outgassing when shear localization did not occur. In a natural setting, shear localizes along the edges of a volcanic conduit, where the strain rate is high, causing a highly permeable fracturing layer to form at the conduit's edge and leaving less-sheared and less-outgassed magma at its center. The less-outgassed magma in the center may ascend rapidly and cause explosive volcanism. Non-explosive lava effusion may occur only when shear localization does not occur effectively. This new view explains the rapid ascent of viscous magma and the formation of pyroclasts with contrasting vesicularity (pyroclastic obsidian and highly vesiculated pumice). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Lascar Volcano (5592 m; 23722'S, 67744'W) entered a new period of vigorous activity in 1984, cul-minating in a major explosive eruption in April 1993. Activity since 1984 has been characterised by cyclic be-haviour with recognition of four cycles up to the end of 1993. In each cycle a lava dome is extruded in the active crater, accompanied by vigorous degassing through high-temperature, high-velocity fumaroles distributed on and around the dome. The fumaroles are the source of a sustained steam plume above the volcano. The dome then subsides back into the conduit. During the subsidence phase the velocity and gas output of the fu-maroles decrease, and the cycle is completed by violent explosive activity. Subsidence of both the dome and the crater floor is accommodated by movement on concen-tric, cylindrical or inward-dipping conical fractures. The observations are consistent with a model in which gas loss from the dome is progressively inhibited during a cycle and gas pressure increases within and below the lava dome, triggering a large explosive eruption. Fac-tors that can lead to a decrease in gas loss include a decrease in magma permeability by foam collapse, re-duction in permeability due to precipitation of hydro-thermal minerals in the pores and fractures within the dome and in country rock surrounding the conduit, and closure of open fractures during subsidence of the dome and crater floor. Dome subsidence may be a con-sequence of reduction in magma porosity (foam col-lapse) as degassing occurs and pressurisation develops as the permeability of the dome and conduit system de-creases. Superimposed upon this activity are small ex-plosive events of shallow origin. These we interpret as subsidence events on the concentric fractures leading to short-term pressure increases just below the crater floor.},

Papanastasiou's formula is employed to regularize the discontinuous Bingham model. For both fluid models considered, the distribution of the remaining film on the inner tube wall is non-uniform and only partly follows the tube geometry: it is thinner in the expanding section of the tube, thicker in the contracting one, and as thin as observed in relevant experiments for straight tube segments, if these are long enough. The effect of changes in the diameter of the narrow introductory tube on the width of the remaining film depends on liquid inertia and yield stress. It is confined near the expansion corner for small Reynolds numbers, but causes extended distortions on the free surface for larger ones due to the development of 'lip' or 'corner' vortices on the expanding side of the tube. The increased viscosity of viscoplastic materials, especially where velocity gradients are smaller, reduces the extent of flow and interface fluctuations. Unyielded regions appear along the film remaining on the tube wall, the core area of the main and exit tubes and around the concave corners of the tube. These cause the thinning of the remaining material inside the entrance tube, around the centerline of the main section and the flattening of the bubble front. The size of the solid-like areas increases at higher Reynolds numbers. The tip velocity for both viscous and viscoplastic materials increases along the introductory tube until it attains a maximum, then decreases down to a plateau while it moves inside the main tube, and finally increases again as it approaches the contraction corner. Its values decrease as the Bingham number increases. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hazard assessment and risk mitigation at restless calderas is only possible with adequate geophysical monitoring. We show here how detailed long-term micro-gravity and deformation surveys may contribute to hazard assessment at the Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc) in Italy by evaluating gravity-height change (?? g /?? h ) gradients obtained during ground inflation and deflation between 1981 and 2001. Such gradients provide a framework from which to assess the likelihood and type of volcanic eruptions. Our new analysis of unrest at the CFc allows us to separate 'noise' during the gravity survey from the signal of deep-seated magmatic processes. This facilitates identification of the dynamics within the magma reservoir beneath the CFc. We found that magma replenishment during rapid uplift between 1982 and 1984 was insufficient, probably by one to two orders of magnitude, to trigger an eruption similar to the 1538 Monte Nuovo eruption, the most recent volcanic eruption within the CFc. Furthermore, our interpretation of ?? g /?? h gradients for the ongoing period of deflation since 1984 suggests that eruptive volcanic activity is not imminent. Short periods of minor inflation associated with large gravity changes since 1981 are interpreted to reflect noise, which to some degree is probably due to sub-surface mass/density changes within shallow hydrothermal systems beneath the CFc, indicating no risk of eruptive volcanic activity. We propose that monitoring ?? g /?? h gradients at restless calderas is essential as a caldera develops from a state of unrest to a state where volcanic eruptions have to be anticipated. Adoption of this method for the several tens of restless calderas world-wide will provide early warning of changes in or increase of activity at these supervolcanoes. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Stromboli volcano has been in continuous eruption for several thousand years without major changes in the geometry and feeding system. The thermal structure of its upper part is therefore expected to be close to steady state. In order to mantaim explosive activity, magma must release both gas and heat. It is shown that the thermal and gas budgets of the volcano lead to consistent conclusions. The thermal budget of the volcano is studied by means of a finite-element numerical model under the assumption of conduction heat transfer. It is found that the heat loss through the walls of an eruption conduit is weakly sensitive to the dimensions of underlying magma reservoirs and depends mostly on the radius and length of the conduit. In steady state, this heat loss must be balanced by the cooling of magma which flows through the system. For the magma flux of about 1 kg s-1 corresponding to normal Strombolian activity, this requires that the conduits are a few meters wide and not deeper than a few hundred meters. This implies the existence of a magma chamber at shallow depth within the volcanic edifice. This conclusion is shown to be consistent with considerations on the thermal effects of degassing. In a Strombolian explosion, the mass ratio of gas to lava is very large, commonly exceeding two, which implies that the thermal evolution of the erupting mixture is dominated by that of the gas phase. The large energy loss due to decompression of the gas phase leads to decreased eruption temperatures. The fact that lava is molten upon eruption implies that the mixture does not rise from more than about 200 m depth. To sustain the magmatic and volcanic activity of Stromboli, a mass flux of magma of a few hundred kilograms per second must be supplied to the upper parts of the edifice. This represents either the rate of magma production from the mantle source feeding the volcano or the rate of magma overturn in the interior of a large chamber.},

abstract = {The dynamics of explosive eruptions, such as Plinian, sub-Plinian, Vulcanian, and Strombolian ones, is one of the most fascinating subjects in volcano physics. During the early period of volcanic activity at the Shinmoe-dake Volcano in 2011, various kinds of activities, such as sub-Plinian eruptions, a magma effusion, and Vulcanian eruptions, occurred sequentially. A different kind of tilt motion accompanied each activity. Here we clarify the characteristics of the tilt motions and their time sequences, presenting a new explanation of the triggering mechanism of a Vulcanian eruption. The sub-Plinian and the Vulcanian eruptions at the Shinmoe-dake Volcano were preceded by inflations at shallow depths near the summit. The inflation-deflation cycles were also recorded during the magma-effusive stage, with a typical period of 1 h, synchronized with volcanic tremors or long-period events. Almost all Vulcanian eruptions were preceded by trapezoidal inflations, whose durations systematically lengthened as time progressed, and were followed by various time sequences of tilt motions, which became increasingly more complicated throughout the frequent Vulcanian eruptions. We have found clear linearity with a constant gradient of 0.45 between the logarithm of the preceding duration versus elapsed time for each substage. These observations can be consistently explained based on the assumption that a Vulcanian eruption is induced by a catastrophic rupture of the strongest closed, solid magma frame due to magma degassing overpressure, and the degassing from magma declines exponentially with time.},

abstract = {Strombolian eruptions are considered to be a consequence of the bursting of a large bubble. In order to understand the relation between the style of bubble bursting and the resulting airwave, we perform experiments of bubble bursting at the top of the surface of viscous liquid contained in an acrylic pipe which acts as an air column and observe it visually and acoustically. We find that when the liquid viscosity is less than 1 Pa s, the bubble vibrates before bursting. The major source of the airwave during the sequence of the bubble bursting is the bubble vibration. On the other hand, when the liquid viscosity is greater than 1 Pa s, the bubble does not vibrate. During bubble bursting, an aperture appears on the bubble film. The aperture growth first accelerates and later decelerates before finally stopping. The major source of the airwave is the aperture growth. We calculate a synthetic waveform of the airwave generated by the aperture growth which explains the experimentally observed airwave well. When the frequency of the airwave generated by the aperture growth matches the eigenfrequency of the air column, resonance occurs. Applying this model to the Strombolian eruption, the characteristic low frequency ({\textless}20 Hz) is explained if the velocity of the aperture growth is several meters per second. The model also explains the asymmetrical initial rise of the airwave observed in the Strombolian eruptions as a result of the accelerating growth of the aperture. Citation:},

Observations from laboratory creep failure experiments and precursors to volcanic eruptions are used to test the validity of the approach. Both cumulative and simple moving window techniques are developed to perform predictions and to illustrate the effects of data selection on the results. Laboratory creep failure experiments on granites show that the linear relation works well during the final approach to failure. For blind prediction, the simple moving window technique is preferred because it always uses the most recent data and excludes effects of early data deviating significantly from the predicted trend.

@article{Jaupart1991a,
abstract = {In silicic volcanoes, eruptions commonly begin with violent explosive phases and evolve towards a regime of dome formation. This transition is characterized by a decrease of gas volume fraction, which has usually been attributed to chemical gradients in the volcano chamber. Petrological and geochemical studies suggest that this interpretation may be oversimplified. A critical observation is that the eruption rate decreases with time and is markedly smaller during dome growth than during explosive activity. Following Eichelberger et al. [1], we suggest that the transition from explosive activity to dome formation is due to gas loss through permeable conduit walls. Further, in some cases, the same process may be responsible for the transition from the ash fall regime to pyroclastic flows. Both transitions are a direct consequence of a decrease of eruption rate at constant conduit radius. The gas content of lava rising towards the Earth's surface is determined by two competing processes: pressure release leading to gas exsolution and expansion, and gas loss to the country rock. The amount of gas lost is inversely proportional to the eruption rate and proportional to the pressure difference between conduit and country rock. The critical variable is the pressure in the volcano chamber. This pressure steadily decreases with time as the chamber empties, implying a decrease of eruption rate. In turn, this decrease acts to increase the fraction of gas lost to the country rock and hence to reduce the gas content of the erupted material. The model therefore predicts that, with time, the eruption undergoes a transition from explosive to non-explosive conditions. These transitions occur as bifurcations in the evolution of gas volume fraction with height in the conduit. We find that very small pressure fluctuations of the order of one bar in the chamber lead to large changes of gas content at the vent. This suggests that the transitions of eruptive regime are unstable, and provides an explanation for observed alternations between explosive phases and dome formation. With time, such pressure fluctuations occur when the average vesicularity is smaller and may manifest themselves by extrusion events through an existing dome. In Appendix B, we use data on the height of the Montagne Pel{\'{e}}e spine in 1902 and 1903 to show that the pressure driving this eruption decreased by about 2 MPa in a year. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {[1] The source mechanism of very long period (VLP) signals accompanying volcanic degassing bursts at Popocatepetl is analyzed in the 15 - 70 s band by minimizing the residual error between data and synthetics calculated for a point source embedded in a homogeneous medium. The waveforms of two eruptions ( 23 April and 23 May 2000) representative of mild Vulcanian activity are well reproduced by our inversion, which takes into account volcano topography. The source centroid is positioned 1500 m below the western perimeter of the summit crater, and the modeled source is composed of a shallow dipping crack ( sill with easterly dip of 10 degrees) intersecting a steeply dipping crack ( northeast striking dike dipping 83 degrees northwest), whose surface extension bisects the vent. Both cracks undergo a similar sequence of inflation, deflation, and reinflation, reflecting a cycle of pressurization, depressurization, and repressurization within a time interval of 3 - 5 min. The largest moment release occurs in the sill, showing a maximum volume change of 500 - 1000 m(3), pressure drop of 3 - 5 MPa, and amplitude of recovered pressure equal to 1.2 times the amplitude of the pressure drop. In contrast, the maximum volume change in the dike is less ( 200 - 300 m 3), with a corresponding pressure drop of 1 - 2 MPa and pressure recovery equal to the pressure drop. Accompanying these volumetric sources are single-force components with magnitudes of 10(8) N, consistent with melt advection in response to pressure transients. The source time histories of the volumetric components of the source indicate that significant mass movement starts within the sill and triggers a mass movement response in the dike within a few seconds. Such source behavior is consistent with the opening of a pathway for escape of pent-up gases from slow pressurization of the sill driven by magma crystallization. The opening of this pathway and associated rapid evacuation of volcanic gases induces the pressure drop. Pressure recovery in the magma filling the sill is driven by diffusion of gases from the resulting supersaturated melt into bubbles. Assuming a penny-shaped crack at ambient pressure of 40 MPa, the observed pressure and volume variations can be modeled with the following attributes: crack radius ( 100 m), crack aperture ( 5 m), bubble number density (10(10) - 10(12) m(-3)), initial bubble radius (10(-6) m), final bubble radius (similar to 10(-5) m), and net decrease of gas concentration in the melt (0.01 wt {\%}).},

abstract = {The release of gas from ascending magma is one of the most important factors that controls the style of volcanic eruptions. It is proposed in this paper that the viscous resistance of decompressed magma to gas expansion coupled with the lateral gradient of the ascent velocity can work as a driving force of the permeable gas flow that may transport gas in magma toward the country rock. Based on this idea, the rate of gas loss from magma is calculated in terms of the mean ascent velocity, the gas volume fraction and the 'degassing factor' that is proportional to the magma viscosity and the permeability in the limit of the large gas volume fraction. This formulation of gas loss is applied to a simulation of the magma ascent process to examine the eruption style. For the simulation we employ a model of one-dimensional, non-stationary conduit flow in which volatiles are assumed to move upward with the same speed as the liquid magma and to deposit on bubbles in an amount exceeding the solubility. The simulation reveals that the gas volume fraction in the erupting magma sharply drops from nearly unity to significantly lower values as the dimensionless degassing factor increases and crosses a critical value that is only slightly dependent on various conditions. This consequence yields a simple criterion of the eruption style that displays the ranges of explosive and effusive eruptions on the viscosity-permeability plane separated by a boundary line that shifts following the size and geometry type of the conduit. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The source processes of explosion earthquakes that accompany explosive eruptions at an andesitic volcano Sakurajima, are investigated to clarify the mechanics of explosive eruption. Waveforms of explosion earthquakes are composed of a compressional P-wave first motion (P phase), following a dilatational motion with larger amplitude (D phase) and the largest amplitude motion, with longer period of 2 s (LP phase), which appears 2 to 3 s after the arrival of the P-wave first motion. Analyses of the particle motion, wave attenuation, and propagation velocity show that the P and D phases are composed of P-waves and the LP phase is composed of Rayleigh waves. Moment tensors for these phases are estimated by a waveform inversion method. The waveforms of explosion earthquakes are simulated by 2 sources at depths of about 2 km and 2 sources just beneath the crater. The three diagonal components of the moment tensors of the 1st source generating the P phase have similar positive values for all the events and ranging from 1.1 × 1011 to 8.1 × 1011 Nm. The non-diagonal components are negligibly small compared with the diagonal components. The 2nd source corresponding to the D phase is a contraction source with vertical dipoles of negative values ranging from - 0.4 × 1012 to - 6.1 × 1012 Nm. The horizontal dipoles are about 1012 Nm and about twice as large as the vertical dipoles, ranging from -0.9 × 1012 to -11.8 × 1012 Nm. These results show that the P phase is generated by an isotropic expansion and the source of the D phase is approximated by a contraction of a cylinder at a depth of 2 km beneath the crater. The seismic moment of the cylindrical contraction is 5 to 20 times larger than that of the isotropic expansion, and the origin time of cylindrical contraction source is delayed by 0.2 to 0.5 s from the onset of the isotropic expansion. The LP phase is excited by an isotropic expansion and subsequent horizontal contraction at depths of 0.25-0.5 km beneath the crater bottom. The seismic moments of the shallow isotropic expansion and horizontal contraction sources range from 2.5 × 1011 to 12.8 × 1011 Nm and -2.9 × 1011 to - 13.8 × 1011Nm, respectively. Origin times of the shallow isotropic expansions are delayed by 0.9-1.1 s from the occurrence of explosion earthquakes and coincide with the generation time of the air-shock at the crater bottom. Seismic moments of the shallow isotropic expansion sources are also correlated with the amplitudes of the air-shocks. The source depths of the shallow isotropic expansion and horizontal contraction coincide with that of the rapid deflations that are caused by an outbreak of gas pocket at the uppermost part of the volcanic conduit. It is inferred that the isotropic expansion is caused by instantaneous volume increase of the gas pocket formed at the uppermost region of the volcanic conduit which generates the air-shock. The horizontal contraction reflects decrease in volume caused by pressure decrease due to collapse of the gas pocket.},

abstract = {Hydrogen isotope ratio, water content and Fe 3+/Fe 2+ in coexisting amphibole and biotite phenocrysts in volcanic rocks can provide insight into shallow pre- and syn-eruptive magmatic processes such as vesiculation, and lava drainback with mixing into less devolatilized magma that erupts later in a volcanic sequence. We studied four {\~{}}35ka and younger eruption sequences (i.e. Kings Creek, Lassen Peak, Chaos Crags, and 1915) at the Lassen Volcanic Center (LVC), California, where intrusion of crystal-rich silicic magma mushes by mafic magmas is inferred from the varying abundances of mafic magmatic inclusions (MMIs) in the silicic volcanic rocks. Types and relative proportions of reacted and unreacted hydrous phenocryst populations are evaluated with accompanying chemical and H isotope changes. Biotite phenocrysts were more susceptible to rehydration in older vesicular glassy volcanic rocks than coexisting amphibole phenocrysts. Biotite and magnesiohornblende phenocrysts toward the core of the Lassen Peak dome are extensively dehydroxylated and reacted from prolonged exposure to high temperature, low pressure, and higher f O2 conditions from post-emplacement cooling. In silicic volcanic rocks not affected by alteration, biotite phenocrysts are often relatively more dehydroxylated than are magnesiohornblende phenocrysts of similar size; this is likely due to the ca 10 times larger overall bulk H diffusion coefficient in biotite. A simplified model of dehydrogenation in hydrous phenocrysts above reaction closure temperature suggests that eruption and quench of magma ascended to the surface in a few hours is too short a time for substantial H loss from amphibole. In contrast, slowly ascended magma can have extremely dehydrogenated and possibly dehydrated biotite, relatively less dehydrogenated magnesiohornblende and reaction rims on both phases. Eruptive products containing the highest proportions of mottled dehydrogenated crystals could indicate that within a few days prior to eruption, degassed vesiculated magma or lava had drained back down the volcanic conduit and mixed with less devolatilized magma. The vesiculated magma contained hydrous phenocrysts with lattice damage, which locally raised the effective H diffusion coefficient by ca 10-100× and resulted in increased mineral dehydrogenation. Remobilization of dacite magma mush by relatively more reduced mafic magma appears to have generated further f O2 variations in May 1915 as oxidized magma from shallow levels circulated to depths where dehydrogenation of hydrous phenocrysts began. The $\delta$D Magmatic H2O expressed in LVC acid hot springs is likely a mixture derived from devolatilized ascending mafic magmas and crystallizing silicic magma mush. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

At Mt. Etna volcano (Italy), a pattern recognition system based on infrasonic waveform features has been developed. First, by a parametric power spectrum method, the features describing and characterizing the infrasound events were extracted: peak frequency and quality factor. Then, together with the peak-to-peak amplitude, these features constituted a 3-D  feature space'; by Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm (DBSCAN) three clusters were recognized inside it. After the clustering process, by using a common location method (semblance method) and additional volcanological information concerning the intensity of the explosive activity, we were able to associate each cluster to a particular source vent and/or a kind of volcanic activity. Finally, for automatic event location, clusters were used to train a model based on Support Vector Machine, calculating optimal hyperplanes able to maximize the margins of separation among the clusters. After the training phase this system automatically allows recognizing the active vent with no location algorithm and by using only a single station.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany. The 1914 Taisho eruption of Sakurijima volcano was Japan's highest intensity and magnitude eruption of the twentieth century. After a 35-year period of quiescence, the volcano suddenly rewoke a few days before the eruption, when earthquakes began to be felt on Sakurajima Island. The eruption began on January 12, 1914, from two fissures located on opposite sides of the volcano, and was characterized by a complex time evolution and changes in eruptive styles. The eruption began with a subPlinian explosive phase in which two convective columns rose from the two fissures. Both plumes were sustained for at least 2 days. This resulted in deposition of a widely dispersed tephra sequence. After this phase, the eruption evolved to a final, waning phase, shifting toward effusive activity that lasted until April 1914. During the first weeks, effusive activity was also accompanied by ash emission. The complex sequence of events, characterized by contemporaneous explosive and effusive activity, is typical of several recently observed mid-intensity eruptions, such as during the 2011 eruption of Cord{\'{o}}n Caulle, Chile. The stratigraphic sequence of the eruptive deposits from the Taisho eruption comprises alternating coarse-to-fine lapilli beds with ash beds dispersed toward the ESE and SE. These deposits can be subdivided into three lapilli-bearing units (Units T1, T2 and T3, which correspond to the subPlinian phase) and one ash-bearing unit (Unit T4, which corresponds to the final ash venting, accompanying the first day/weeks of lava flow activity). Grain size analyses from each unit reveal a marked polymodal distribution generally described by the sum of two or three Gaussian subpopulations. Both the modes and the relative amounts of the coarse subpopulations vary with distance from vent, with those of the fine subpopulation remaining nearly constant. Within the vertical sequence, component analysis shows a progressive increase in lithic fragments, suggesting that conduit enlargement continued until the final stages of the eruption. The estimated volume of the tephra deposit of the subPlinian phase of the eruption is 0.33 ± 0.11 km3(dense rock equivalent (DRE) volume = 0.09 ± 0.03 km3). The height of the eruption column was also assessed by using four different isopleth maps compiled based on different strategies for the characterization of the largest clasts. The maximum height attained by the eruption column is estimated at 15.0 ± 1.2 km above the vent, resulting in a maximum mass discharge rate of 3.6 ± 1.2 × 107 kg s−1(calculated taking into account the strong effect of wind advection). Finally, different classification schemes were applied to classify the eruption, which generally straddles the fields between Plinian and subPlinian.},

abstract = {A 2.5-month long gravity sequence, encompassing the starting period of the 2002-2003 Etna eruption and coming from a summit station only 1 km away from the new fractures, is presented and discussed. The sequence comprises four hours-long anomalies that have a great chance to reflect mass redistributions linked to the ensuing activity. In particular, the start of the eruptive activity on the northeastern flank was marked by a gravity decrease as strong as about 400 ??Gal, which reverted soon afterwards. This strong decrease/increase anomaly is interpreted as the opening, by tectonic forces, of a fracture system along the Northeastern Rift of Mt. Etna, followed by an intrusion of magma from the central conduit to the new fractures. They were used by the intruding magma as a path to the eruptive vents at lower elevations. Afterwards, on three occasions, in November and December 2002, 6-12 h-lasting gravity decreases, with amplitude ranging between 10 and 30 ??Gal, were observed simultaneously with increases in the amplitude of the volcanic tremor from four seismic stations. A correlation analysis, between the gravity signal and the overall spectral amplitude of each tremor sequence is performed over the 7 November-9 December period. A marked anti-correlation is found over each contemporaneous gravity decrease/tremor increase, while, over the rest of the investigated period, the correlation is negligible. Accordingly, a joint source is inferred to have acted during the occurrence of the three common anomalies. On the grounds of some volcanological observations spanning the period covered by our analysis, we propose the temporary accumulation of a gas cloud at some level within the plumbing system of the volcano to have acted as a joint source. The present work is a further evidence of the potential of continuous gravity observations as a tool to monitor and study active volcanoes and encourages their employment in spite of the difficulty of running spring gravimeters in a continuous fashion under the adverse conditions normally encountered on the summit zone of an active volcano. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Volcanic tremor and low frequency events, together with infrasound signals, can represent important precursory phenomena of eruptive activity because of their strict relationship with eruptive mechanisms and with fluid flows through the volcano's feeding system. Important variations of these seismo-volcanic and infrasound signals, recorded at Mt. Etna volcano, occurred both in the medium-and short-term before the eruption, that took place on 13 May 2008. The most significant changes were observed in the frequency content and location of LP events, as well as in volcanic tremor location, that allowed us to track the magma pathway feeding the 2008 eruptive activity. The infrasound showed three different families of events linked to the activity of the three active vents: North-East Crater, South-East crater and the eruptive fissure. The seismic and infrasonic variations reported, corroborated by ground deformations variations, help to develop a quantitative prediction and early-warning system for effusive and/or explosive eruptions.

abstract = {Digital algorithms for robust detection of phase arrivals in the presence of stationary and nonstationary noise have a long history in seismology and have been exploited primarily to reduce the amount of data recorded by data logging systems to manageable levels. In the present era of inexpensive digital storage, how- ever, such algorithms are increasingly being used to flag signal segments in contin- uously recorded digital data streams for subsequent processing by automatic and/or expert interpretation systems. In the course of our development of an automated, near-real-time, waveform correlation event-detection and location system (WCEDS), we have surveyed the abilities of such algorithms to enhance seismic phase arrivals in teleseismic data streams. Specifically, we have considered envelopes generated by energy transient (STA/LTA), Z-statistic, frequency transient, and polarization algo- rithms. The WCEDS system requires a set of input data streams that have a smooth, low-amplitude response to background noise and seismic coda and that contain peaks at times corresponding to phase arrivals. The algorithm used to generate these input streams from raw seismograms must perform well under a wide range of source, path, receiver, and noise scenarios. Present computational capabilities allow the ap- plication of considerably more robust algorithms than have been historically used in real time. However, highly complex calculations can still be computationally pro- hibitive for current workstations when the number of data streams become large. While no algorithm was clearly optimal under all source, receiver, path, and noise conditions tested, an STA/LTA algorithm incorporating adaptive window lengths con- trolled by nonstationary seismogram spectral characteristics was found to provide an output that best met the requirements of a global correlation-based event-detection and location system.},

abstract = {An effective approach to understanding the dynamics of explosive volcanic eruptions and the conduit systems that drive them is through synergy of multiple data sets. Three data sets that lend themselves to ease of integration are seismic, infrasonic and thermal. Although approaches involving these data have been used to record volcanological phenomena since 1862, 1955 and 1965, respectively, their integrated use has only developed since 1999. When combined, these three data sets allow constraint of shallow system geometry and the dynamics of the explosive events that occur within that system. Using Stromboli volcano (Italy) as a case study, we review the complete range of geochemical and geophysical studies that can be applied. In doing so, we aim to show how integration of these diverse studies allows insights into a plumbing system and the dynamics of the eruptive activity that the system feeds. When combined at Stromboli, these data provide constraint of multiple system parameters including chamber depths, gas and magma fluxes, shallow system magma residence times, explosion source depths, and the rise/ejection velocities of ascending gas slugs and ejecta. In turn, these results allow various conduit and eruption dynamic models to be applied and tested. The persistent and repeated mildly explosive events that characterize Stromboli have been modeled in terms of the coalescence of gas within the magma to form large gas slugs that ascend the remaining portion of the conduit to burst at the free surface. Our integrated seismic, infrasonic and thermal data sets indicate that gas coalescence occurs at a depth of ∼260 m, with a typical event frequency of ∼9/h. Infrasonic and thermal data show the explosion source to be located 20-220 m below the vent. Thermal data give emission velocities for the ejected fragments of 8-20 m/s, which converts to gas jet velocities of 23-39 m/s. Tracking these parameters in space and time shows that, although eruptions at Stromboli can be grouped into two characteristic types (simple and complex-each of which characterizes a particular crater, NE and SW, respectively), events within each type show significant short-term variability. The system does, however, appear robust, maintaining its characteristic strombolian eruption style after significant effusive phases and more energetic explosive events. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {Silicate-melt inclusions in phenocrysts from the recent (A.D. 1631-1944) Vesuvius lavas have been analyzed in order to improve the knowledge on the physico-chemical conditions of the host magmas. Petrographic, SEM-EDS and electron microprobe analyses have been performed. Two kinds of silicate-melt inclusions were found in the phenocrysts. The first and most common type is primary in origin and occurs along the former growth surfaces of the host crystals. The second type is secondary and/or pseudosecondary in origin and occurs along healed fractures. Microprobe analyses on primary silicate-melt inclusions in clinopyroxene show compositional variations between the inclusions in the core and the rim of the host phase. The variation diagrams of major elements versus silica have been used to qualitatively distinguish the phases involved in pre- and post-trapping processes. In particular, the chemical composition of silicate-melt inclusions indicate the fractional crystallization of clinopyroxene+plagioclase??FeTi oxides. Based on these data we can suggest that, during the recent activity of Vesuvius, fractional crystallization was the main differentiation process. However, the evolution of Vesuvius magmas may be also subjected to a convective process involving clinopyroxene crystals. Finally, this fractionated environment may be interrupted by inputs of more primitive magmas. The mixing between the fresh, unfractionated magma with the evolved one produced silicate-melt inclusions more basic and reverse and/or oscillatory zonings in clinopyroxenes. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {Flow pattern, void fraction and slug rise velocity on counter-current two-phase flow in a vertical round tube with wire-coil inserts are experimentally studied. Flow pattern and slug rise velocity are measured visually with a video camera. The void fraction is measured by the quick-closing valve method. Four kinds of coils with different coil pitches and coil diameters are used as inserts. The presence of wire-coil inserts induces disturbance into gas and liquid flows so that the shape and motion of gas slug or bubbles in a wire-coil inserted tube are quite different from those observed in a smooth tube without insert. The bubbly flow occurs in the low gas superficial velocity region in the wire-coil inserted tube, while the slug or churn/annular flow only appears in the smooth tube without insert over the all test range. The measured slug rise velocity in the wire-coil inserted tube is higher than that in the smooth tube. With modified mean flow velocity calculated with core area, the slug rise velocity in wire-coil tube inserted is in good agreement with Nicklin's correlation. The void fraction in a wire-coil inserted tube is lower than that in a smooth tube in the range of high gas superficial velocities. By introducing a simple assumption on considering the effective flowing area, the measured void fractions in a wire-coil inserted tube are in relatively good agreement with the predicted result based on the drift flux model proposed by others with the correlation for slug rise velocity given by others when the coil pitch is dense. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Volcanic stratigraphy is a fundamental component of geological mapping in volcanic areas as it yields the basic criteria and essential data for identifying the spatial and temporal relationships between volcanic products and intra/inter-eruptive processes (earth-surface, tectonic and climatic), which in turn provides greater understanding of the geological evolution of a region. Establishing precise stratigraphic relationships in volcanic successions is not only essential for understanding the past behaviour of volcanoes and for predicting how they might behave in the future, but is also critical for establishing guidelines for exploring economic and energy resources associated with volcanic systems or for reconstructing the evolution of sedimentary basins in which volcanism has played a significant role. Like classical stratigraphy, volcanic stratigraphy should also be defined using a systematic methodology that can provide an organised and comprehensive description of the temporal and spatial evolution of volcanic terrain. This review explores different methods employed in studies of volcanic stratigraphy, examines four case studies that use differing stratigraphic approaches, and recommends methods for using systematic volcanic stratigraphy based on the application of the concepts of traditional stratigraphy but adapted to the needs of volcanological environment.},

abstract = {The heights of lava fountains formed in Hawaiian-style eruptions are controlled by magma gas content, volume flux and the amounts of lava re-entrainment and gas bubble coalescence. Theoretical models of lava fountaining are used to analyse data on lava fountain height variations collected during the 1983–1986 Pu'u 'O'o vent of Kilauea volcano, Hawaii. The results show that the variable fountain heights can be largely explained by the impact of variations in volume flux and amount of lava re-entrainment on erupting magmas with a constant gas content of 0.32 wt.{\%} H2O. However, the gas content of the magma apparently declined by 0.05 wt.{\%} during the last 10 episodes of the eruption series and this decline is attributed to more extensive pre-eruption degassing due to a shallowing of the sub-vent feeder dike. It is concluded that variations in lava fountain height cannot be simply interpreted as variations in gas content, as has previously been suggested, but that fountain height can still be a useful guide to minimum gas contents. Where sufficient data are available on eruptive volume fluxes and extent of lava entrainment, greatly improved estimates can be made of magma gas content from lava fountain height.},

abstract = {Magma fragmentation is the breakup of a continuous volume of molten rock into discrete pieces, called pyroclasts. Because magma contains bubbles of compressible magmatic volatiles, decompression of low-viscosity magma leads to rapid expansion. The magma is torn into fragments, as it is stretched into hydrodynamically unstable sheets and filaments. If the magma is highly viscous, resistance to bubble growth will instead lead to excess gas pressure and the magma will deform viscoelastically by fracturing like a glassy solid, resulting in the formation of a violently expanding gas-pyroclast mixture. In either case, fragmentation represents the conversion of potential energy into the surface energy of the newly created fragments and the kinetic energy of the expanding gas-pyroclast mixture. If magma comes into contact with external water, the conversion of thermal energy will vaporize water and quench magma at the melt-water interface, thus creating dynamic stresses that cause fragmentation and the release of kinetic energy. Lastly, shear deformation of highly viscous magma may cause brittle fractures and release seismic energy.},

Joint observations and modeling allow the extraction of acoustic energy related to the magnitude of initial ground deformation, the contribution of gas breakout, and the timing of the fallback of displaced material. The existence and relative acoustic amplitudes of these three phases depended on the size and depth of the explosion. The results motivate a conceptual model that relates successive contributions from ground acceleration, gas breakout, and spall fallback to the acoustic amplitude and waveform characteristics of buried explosions. We place the literature on infrasound signals at Santiaguito Volcano, Guatemala, and Sakurajima and Suwonosejima Volcanoes, Japan, in the context of this model.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of long-term stability of stiff clay and clay shale slopes, and detailed reanalyses of 99 case histories of slope failures in 36 soft clays to stiff clays and clay shales. We analyzed 107 sections using the observed actual slip surface. In a first-time slope failure in clay or shale, part or all of the slip surface is unsheared prior to the occurrence of the landslide. Most stiff clays and clay shales contain stratigraphic discontinuities such as bedding planes and laminations. The fully softened shear strength is shown to be the lower bound for mobilized shear strength in first-time slope failures in homogeneous soft to stiff clays and on the slip surfaces cutting across bedding planes and laminations. For many of the first-time slope failures it appears that part of the slip surface is at the residual condition. For excavated slopes, the residual condition could be present before the final slope is formed, or it may develop in response to excavation by progressive deformation along nearly horizontal surfaces including bedding planes or laminations. In addition to the permeability dependent rise in porewater pressure, and softening, delayed first-time failure of slopes in stiff clays and clay shales is caused by propagation of the residual condition into the slope, on horizontal or subhorizontal surfaces including stratigraphic discontinuities. The residual condition is present on the entire surface of reactivated landslides.},

abstract = {Velocity measurements were made on single cylindrical air bubbles rising in a variety of liquids contained in vertically mounted tubes sealed at the lower end. A general graphical correlation iniolving Fr = ua/gd, Eb = pgdz/u and Y = gcc4/pos is given. It is shown that {\&}ous effects are of minor importance if pagds/pz {\textgreater} 3 x 106, interfacial effects if Eo {\textgreater} 70 and inertial if Fr {\textless} 0*003. Evidence suggests that the general correlation is also applicable to limiting velocity data for smaller (non-cylindrical) bubbles.},

abstract = {The pressurization of pore fluids plays a significant role in deforming volcanic materials; however, understanding of this process remains incomplete, especially scenarios accompanying phreatic eruptions. Analog experiments presented here use a simple geometry to study the mechanics of this type of deformation. Syrup was injected into the base of a sand medium, simulating the permeable flow of fluids through shallow volcanic systems. The experiments examined surface deformation over many source depths and pressures. Surface deformation was recorded using a Microsoft {\textregistered} Kinect™ sensor, generating high-spatiotemporal resolution lab-scale digital elevation models (DEMs). The behavior of the system is controlled by the ratio of pore pressure to lithostatic loading ($\lambda$ = p/$\rho$gD). For $\lambda$ {\textless} 10, deformation was accommodated by high-angle, reversed-mechanism shearing along which fluid preferentially flowed, leading to a continuous feedback between deformation and pressurization wherein higher pressure ratios yielded larger deformations. For $\lambda$ {\textgreater} 10, fluid expulsion from the layer was much faster, vertically fracturing to the surface with larger pressure ratios yielding less deformation. The temporal behavior of deformation followed a characteristic evolution that produced an approximately exponential increase in deformation with time until complete layer penetration. This process is distinguished from magmatic sources in continuous geodetic data by its rapidity and characteristic time evolution. The time evolution of the experiments compares well with tilt records from Mt. Ontake, Japan, in the lead-up to the deadly 2014 phreatic eruption. Improved understanding of this process may guide the evolution of magmatic intrusions such as dikes, cone sheets, and cryptodomes and contribute to caldera resurgence or deformation that destabilizes volcanic flanks.},

abstract = {Thermal imagery obtained with portable infrared cameras is widely used to track and measure volcanic phenomena. In the case of explosive eruptions, both air and ground-based thermal monitoring have enabled collection of data streams from relatively safe distances. Analysis of these data have enabled the characterisation of different explosive regimes, parameterisation of eruptive plumes, and assessment on the dynamics occurring in the shallow system. Here we explore the suitability of infrared imagers for investigating the short time scale eruptive behaviour of three basaltic volcanoes. We present high-time resolution thermal image data-sets recorded at Etna, Stromboli and Kīlauea volcano. At the time of observations, all three exhibited pulsed degassing. Signal processing of the mean apparent temperature time-series highlights four broad classes of cyclic temperature changes at the three volcanoes based on characteristic time-scales revealed in the periodograms: (1) {\textless}15 s, (2) 20-50 s, (3) 1-10 min, and (4) 12–90 min. Based on previous studies and integrating time-series results with qualitative visible and thermal observations and, in case of Kīlauea, also with SO 2 column amounts in the plume, we hypothesise that short cycles relate mainly to bursting of overpressured gas bubbles at the magma surface, while long cycles might be associated with mechanisms of gas slug formation and ascent, and to the emplacement and drainage of a lava lake. At Kīlauea, slow fluctuations may reflect periodic variations of the lava lake surface level. The data from all three volcanoes reveal superimposition of degassing cycles of different frequencies, suggesting link through common magmatic processes and physical properties.},

The modeled material is a mixture of polymer EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate) and non-colloidal spherical powder (glass microspheres) with mean particle size within 53???63????m. The effect of particle concentration on wall slip was studied experimentally in a capillary rheometer. For suspensions with different particle loadings (35{\%}, 40{\%}, and 45{\%} by volume), the slip velocity Vs increased with an increase of particle concentration at the same testing temperature. A master slip curve can be obtained by plotting slip velocity versus the product of wall shear stress and square root of particle concentration. As such, a new particle concentration-dependent slip model is proposed. A theoretical approach coupled with the new slip model and flow equation is employed to characterize the flow behavior of concentrated suspension in a capillary rheometer, with reasonable agreement obtained with experimental observations. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present an analysis of lava dome growth during the 2004-2008 eruption of Mount St. Helens using oblique terrestrial images from a network of remotely placed cameras. This underutilized monitoring tool augmented more traditional monitoring techniques, and was used to provide a robust assessment of the nature, pace, and state of the eruption and to quantify the kinematics of dome growth. Eruption monitoring using terrestrial photography began with a single camera deployed at the mouth of the volcano's crater during the first year of activity. Analysis of those images indicates that the average lineal extrusion rate decayed approximately logarithmically from about 8 m/d to about 2 m/d (?? 2 m/d) from November 2004 through December 2005, and suggests that the extrusion rate fluctuated on time scales of days to weeks. From May 2006 through September 2007, imagery from multiple cameras deployed around the volcano allowed determination of 3-dimensional motion across the dome complex. Analysis of the multi-camera imagery shows spatially differential, but remarkably steady to gradually slowing, motion, from about 1-2 m/d from May through October 2006, to about 0.2-1.0 m/d from May through September 2007. In contrast to the fluctuations in lineal extrusion rate documented during the first year of eruption, dome motion from May 2006 through September 2007 was monotonic (?? 0.10 m/d) to gradually slowing on time scales of weeks to months. The ability to measure spatial and temporal rates of motion of the effusing lava dome from oblique terrestrial photographs provided a significant, and sometimes the sole, means of identifying and quantifying dome growth during the eruption, and it demonstrates the utility of using frequent, long-term terrestrial photography to monitor and study volcanic eruptions.},

abstract = {Forecasting is a central goal of volcanology. Intensive monitoring of recent eruptions has generated integrated time-series of data, which have resulted in several successful examples of warnings being issued on impending eruptions. Ability to forecast is being advanced by new technology, such as broad-band seismology, satellite observations of ground deformation and improved field spectrometers for volcanic gas studies, and spectacular advances in computer power and speed, leading to improvements in data transmission, data analysis and modelling techniques. Analytical studies of volcanic samples, experimental investigations and theoretical modelling are providing insights into the dynamics of magmatic systems, giving a physical framework with which to interpret volcanic phenomena. Magmas undergo profound changes in physical properties as pressure and temperature vary during magma chamber evolution, magma ascent and eruption. Degassing and cooling during magma ascent induce crystallisation and increases of viscosity, strength and compressibility, commonly by several orders of magnitude. Active magmatic systems also interact strongly with their surroundings, causing ground deformation, material failure and other effects such as disturbed groundwater systems and degassing. These processes and interactions lead to geophysical and phenomenological effects, which precede and accompany eruptions. Forecasting of hazardous volcanic phenomena is becoming more quantitative and based on understanding of the physics of the causative processes. Forecasting is evolving from empirical pattern recognition to forecasting based on models of the underlying dynamics. The coupling of highly non-linear and complex kinetic and dynamic processes leads to a rich range of behaviours. Due to intrinsic uncertainties and the complexity of non-linear systems, precise prediction is usually not achievable. Forecasts of eruptions and hazards need to be expressed in probabilistic terms that take account of uncertainties. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Simulations provide crucial insights into the effects of the generation mechanism of the flows - partial collapse vs boiling-over on their evolution and hazard potential, the unstable dynamics of the fountain, and the influence of Mount Somma on the propagation of PDCs into the circum-Vesuvian area, one of the world's most hazardous volcanic settings. Results also show that it is possible to characterize the volcanic column behavior in terms of percentage of the mass of pyroclasts collapsed to the ground and how this parameter strongly influences the dynamics and hazard of the associated PDCs.},

abstract = {Mt. Etna, in Sicily (Italy) is well known for frequent effusive and explosive eruptions from both its summit and flanks. South-East Crater (SE Crater), one of the four summit craters, has been the most active in the last 20 years and often produces episodic lava fountains over periods lasting from a few weeks to months. The most striking of such eruptive phases was in 2000. Sixty four lava fountains, separated by quiescent intervals and sometimes associated with lava overflows, occurred that year between January and June, a time period during which we consider the volcano to have been in episodic eruption. This paper presents mainly results of petrochemical inves- tigations carried out on both tephra and lavas collected during a number of the lava fountain episodes in 2000. The new data have been integrated with volcanological and seismic infor- mation in order to correlate the features of the eruptive activity with magma-gas dynamics in the plumbing system of SE Crater. The main findings allow us to characterise the 2000 episodic eruption in the framework of the recent SE Crater activity. In particular, we infer that the onset of the 2000 eruption was triggered by the ascent of new, more primitive and volatile-rich magma that progressively intruded into the SE Crater reservoir, where it mixed with the resident, more evolved magma. Furthermore, we argue that the 2000 SE Crater lava fountains largely resulted from the instability of a foam layer accumulated at the top of the underlying reservoir and rebuilt prior to each episode, in agreement with the collapsing foam model for lava fountains.},

abstract = {We present results from a detailed analysis of seismic and infrasonic data recorded over a four day period prior to the Vulcanian eruptive event at Sakurajima volcano on May 19, 1998. Nearly one hundred seismic and infrasonic events were recorded on at least one of the nine seismic-infrasonic stations located within 3 km of the crater. Four unique seismic event types are recognized based on the spectral features of seismograms, including weak seismic tremor characterized by a 5-6 Hz peak mode that later shifted to 4-5 Hz. Long-period events are characterized by a short-duration, wide spectral band signal with an emergent, high-frequency onset followed by a wave coda lasting 15-20 s and a fundamental mode of 4.2-4.4 Hz. Values of Q for long-period events range between 10 and 22 suggesting that a gas-rich fluid was involved. Explosive events are the third seismic type, characterized by a narrow spectral band signal with an impulsive high-frequency onset followed by a 20-30 second wave coda and a peak mode of 4.0-4.4 Hz. Volcano-tectonic earthquakes are the fourth seismic type. Prior to May 19, 1998, only the tremor and explosion seismic events are found to have an infrasonic component. Like seismic tremor, infrasonic tremor is typically observed as a weak background signal. Explosive infrasonic events were recorded 10-15 s after the explosive seismic events and with audible explosions prior to May 19. On May 19, high-frequency impulsive infrasonic events occurred sporadically and as swarms within hours of the eruption. These infrasonic events are observed to be coincident with swarms of long-period seismic events. Video coverage during the seismic-infrasonic experiment recorded intermittent releases of gases and ash during times when seismic and acoustic events were recorded. The sequence of seismic and infrasonic events is interpreted as representing a gas-rich fluid moving through a series of cracks and conduits beneath the active summit crater. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Multiphase magma rheological properties play a fundamental role on lava flow transport, emplacement and morphology. To date, however, the three-phase (melt+crystals+bubbles) rheology of natural magma remains relatively understudied. We present here a series of high-temperature experiments designed to investigate the multiphase rheology of a mugearitic megacryst-bearing lava from Mt. Etna. A peculiar textural feature of this magma is the abundance of cm-size plagioclase crystals (megacrysts) together with smaller size crystals (phenocrysts and microlites), yielding a very wide crystal size distribution. We combined different experimental techniques (rotational and compressional rheometry) to investigate the rheology of this natural lava under different degrees of partial melting at subliquidus conditions. Results indicate that natural megacryst-bearing mugearite magmas from Mt. Etna display a wide range of behaviors as a function of temperature (T =1000-1200??C) and crystal content (??(symbol)X =0.2-0.7). In the investigated T range, the deformation mechanism of these magmas varies from mainly brittle (T {\textless}1050??C) to mainly ductile (T {\textgreater}1085??C). At T =1075??C, both ductile and brittle behavior have been observed. In the ductile regime, these magmas behave as non-Newtonian fluids (at least up to T =1100??C) showing marked apparent shear thinning behavior. The observed rheological behavior is due to a complex response related to a non-homogenous deformation of the natural sample (e.g. viscous and/or brittle shear localization), favored by the presence of bubbles. Consequently, the obtained flow parameters can be considered as representative of the bulk rheology of natural magmas, commonly characterized by similar non-homogeneous deformation styles. We applied the obtained data to discuss the flow and emplacement conditions of these peculiar lava flows. We demonstrated that at eruptive temperatures, the presence of a pre-eruptive crystal cargo and bubbles facilitates the achievement of critical crystal content during flow and cooling, ultimately controlling lava transport and emplacement. Flow conditions can be maintained in the presence of an efficient insulation and, importantly, of deformable vesicles promoting and enhancing shear localization.},

abstract = {The lightning generated by explosive volcanic eruptions is of interest not only as a promising technique for monitoring volcanic activity, but also for its broader implications and possible role in the origin of life on Earth, and its impact on the atmosphere and biosphere of the planet. However, at present the genetic mechanisms and physical properties of volcanic lightning remain poorly understood, as compared to our understanding of thundercloud lightning. Here, we present joint magnetotelluric (MT) data and video imagery that were used to investigate the physical properties of electrical discharges generated during explosive activity at Sakurajima volcano, Japan, and we compare these data with the characteristics of thundercloud lightning. Using two weeks of high-sensitivity, high-sample-rate MT data recorded in 2013, we detected weak electromagnetic signals radiated by volcanic lightning close to the crater. By carefully inspecting all MT waveforms that synchronized with visible flashes, and comparing with high-speed (3000 frame/s) and normal-speed (30 frame/s) videos, we identified two types of discharges. The first type consists of impulses (Type A) and is interpreted as cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning. The second type is characterized by weak electromagnetic variations with multiple peaks (Type B), and is interpreted as intra-cloud (IC) lightning. In addition, we observed a hybrid MT event wherein a continuous weak current accompanied Type A discharge. The observed features of volcanic lightning are similar to thunderstorm lightning, and the physical characteristics show that volcanic lightning can be treated as a miniature version of thunderstorm lightning in many respects. The overall duration, length, inter-stroke interval, peak current, and charge transfer all exhibit values 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than those of thunderstorm lightning, thus suggesting a scaling relation between volcanic and thunderstorm lightning parameters that is independent of the type of charged particles. On the other hand, the polarities, which are estimated by long-time (3.4 yrs) MT (32 samples/s) and video (30 frame/s) observations, are different than those of normal thunderstorm lightning. These observations are consistent with the notion that charge structures in volcanic ash plumes are highly disordered and are characterized by numerous small charged regions with high charge density.},

abstract = {In December 2002 Stromboli Volcano erupted triggering a sector collapse and a tsunami. During the 7 month-long effusive eruption, the typical persistent and moderate explosive activity of Stromboli ceased. However, very long period ( VLP) seismic events, typically associated with the explosions at Stromboli, were recorded during the effusive eruption. These were clustered mainly in two groups with stable waveforms. This suggests that strombolian activity never ceased but was confined deep within the magma conduit. A location method, based on the seismic directivity recorded with an asynchronous seismic deployment, positioned the two clusters similar to60 m apart from each other at similar to510 m a. s. l. and similar to180 m NW from the summit craters. However, seismic polarization reveals a similar to50 m upward migration of the VLP source at the end of the eruption when volcanic activity moved from the effusive style to more typical strombolian activity.},

abstract = {The liquidus temperature of magma that reaches shallow levels during its ascent may change abruptly as a result of the release of volatiles or through magma mixing or a combination of both. Immediately after this abrupt change of the liquidus temperature occurs a disequilibrium is observed in the melt, and here it is shown that the melt rapidly re-equilibrates to its thermodynamic equilibrium. A quantitative model for cooling and crystallization of a simple two-component model melt is used to investigate such re-equilibration processes. The relaxation time, defined as the time required for the system to re-equilibrate after varying degrees of liquidus temperature perturbations, is found to be ∼3{\%} or significantly less than the time it takes to crystallize ∼40{\%} of the melt, regardless of the amplitude of the perturbation. Associated with the re-equilibration process is an increase in crystal fraction that can easily reach 10{\%} depending on the amplitude of the perturbation. During the compensation of the liquidus temperature perturbation, the temperature of the melt remains nearly constant or may even increase slightly (depending on the latent heat budget, possibly heat of mixing, and heat absorbed during volatile exsolution), which suggests crystallization of the melt without cooling. },

Once the prior distribution is determined, the parameters used in the analysis model are obtained by maximizing the posterior distribution of the parameters.

abstract = {The study of active vent dynamics is hindered by the difficulty of directly observing features and processes during eruptive periods. Here, we describe some recent observations of the summit dome activity of Santiaguito volcano, Guatemala, from the vantage point of its parent, Santa Mar{\'{i}}a. We have taken 12 h of digital video of activity over a 3-year period, which includes 28 eruptions and numerous smaller gas exhalations. Santiaguito persistently extrudes a dacitic lava flow, and produces strombolian eruptions on the order of every 0.5 to 2 h; we have documented many of these eruptions as emitting from a ring-shaped set of fractures in the dome surface. The ring has apparently grown from 70 m diameter in 2002 to 120 m in 2004, which could reflect an increasing conduit opening. Eruptions typically consist of 30-60 s of vigorous emissions; measurements of emission exit velocities have ranged from 5 to 30 m/s. The observed ash bursts, correlated with measured extrusion rates, suggest an incremental plug flow through the conduit. Bubble generation and shearing at the conduit boundaries produce the ring-shaped ash and gas pulses. Continued field studies from this unique observation site may help relate summit emission characteristics to conduit geometry and eruption processes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Stromboli volcano (Southern Italy) is one of the most monitored volcano in the world with a surveillance network that includes a permanently sited ground-based SAR interferometer (GBInSAR). This work is the review of the GBInSAR data gained from the last decade of monitoring activity. The analysis of the entire dataset of GBInSAR measurements allowed the assessment of the deformation field of the northern part of the summit crater area and the Sciara del Fuoco depression. In detail, the main displacements recognized can be related to different factors: 1) the inflation/deflation respectively immediately before and after each new effusive event; 2) the bulging of localized sectors of the volcano involved in the vent opening; 3) the gravitational sliding of the Sciara del Fuoco infill; 4) the movement of lava flows. Accelerations in this sector are related to sheet intrusions, while the possibility of vent opening, associated with small sliding, or catastrophic flank failure are related to highly overpressurized sheets, able to produce high displacement rate in the Sciara del Fuoco.In the summit crater area, the increases in the displacement rate are related to the pressurization of the shallow conduit system, as the consequence of the variation in the magma level (magmastatic pressure) or to the lateral magma migration (lateral conduit expansion or dike intrusion) in response to the increase of the overpressure component. Fluctuations in the displacement rate in the summit crater area can be related to the magma overturning within the conduit, with the increases in displacement rate during the upwelling of less dense magma, while displacement rate decreases as the degassed magma column is pushed out from the conduit (lava flows or overflows). Instead, the decrease in the displacement rate without coeval lava outpouring could be related to the sink of the degassed magma due to density contrast between the gas-poor and the gas-charged magmas. Using the displacement rate in the summit crater area as a proxy for the variation in the pressure condition in conduit (both magmastatic and overpressure components), thresholds for the crises characterized by the occurrence of overflows (eventually associated with major explosions) and flank effusions (eventually associated with paroxysmal explosions) are identified. Small conduit overpressure will produce overflows (sometimes associated with crater-rim collapses), while large magma overpressure will laterally expand the conduit forming NE-SW striking sheets, feeding eruptive vents at the base of the summit crater area and within the Sciara del Fuoco, generating conditions of instability that can evolve into catastrophic collapse of the instable flank.},

abstract = {The prevalence of andesitic and dacitic volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years has led to a new appreciation of processes typical of magmas of intermediate composition. Extensive syn-eruptive crystallization, driven by decompression and volatile exsolution, is one such process. A water-saturated melt that is decompressed isothermally from its liquidus must crystallize in response to the diminishing capacity of the melt to retain volatiles (particularly H2O). Only rapid magma ascent allows such a melt to reach the Earth's surface without crystallizing. Intermediate rates of ascent permit varying amounts of syn-eruptive crystallization, which in turn changes magma rheology and affects continued magma progress toward the surface. Feedback among magma decompression, vesiculation, and crystallization is poorly understood, particularly with regard to the kinetics of crystallization. Here we present two complementary approaches to the study of syn-eruptive, degassing-induced crystallization. The first involves projection of matrix glass compositions onto the well-understood Qz-Ab-Or ternary, which allows relative (quartz-undersaturated melt) or absolute (quartz-saturated melt) determination of magma equilibration (or closure') pressure. We show that glass composition (groundmass crystallinity) changes as a function of decompression rate, and that either very slow ascent or rapid ascent followed by arrest and shallow cooling can lead to extensive cotectic precipitation of quartz + feldspar. The second approach involves quantification of plagioclase textures, which provides a direct measurement of the relative importance of crystal nucleation and growth (J/G). This parameter can, in turn, be linked to the effective undercooling (supersaturation) experienced during decompression. Finally, we use phenocryst melt inclusion data to suggest that a substantial amount of phenocryst crystallization may also be explained by decompression of water-saturated melt.},

abstract = {Collapse of a Taylor bubble inside a pipe at the free surface of a liquid is studied experimentally using speed imaging camera and illumination and subsequent image analysis. Three different fluids, water, glycerin, and silicone oil, are employed in the experiments. For all conditions studied herein, the bubble punctures at the free surface to form two thin films, i.e., one covering the cross-section of the tube near the free surface and one along the tube wall in the vertical direction. Surface tension acts to collapse the first film, which widens the punctured hole in the outward radial direction, thereby feeding the liquid in the vertical film. After the shrinking of the radial film, gravity causes the collapse of the vertical film, which generates a tiny jet of liquid at the end of collapse. Experiments with different fluids show a drastic change in shape and thickness of the vertical film that leads to higher drainage time. Analysis of time scale for the drainage of the horizontal film exhibits a favorable match with experiments. Finally, evolution of the vertical film is analyzed using a simple hydrodynamic model to estimate the order magnitude of time taken to collapse, which compares well with processed image data from experiments.},

Enforcement is often difficult and problems can be exacerbated when major eruptions do not ensue. Families are deprived of livelihoods and pressure to return to hazardous areas builds. Concomitantly, prevailing socio-economic and political conditions limit activities and can influence vulnerability. This paper addresses these issues, examining an ongoing volcano hazard (Tungurahua) in Ecuador where contextual realities significantly constrain responses. Fieldwork involved interviewing government officials, selecting focus groups and conducting surveys of evacuees in four locations: a temporary shelter, a permanent resettlement, with returnees and with a control group. Differences in perceptions of risk and health conditions, and in the potential for economic recovery were found among groups with different evacuation experiences. The long-term goal is to develop a model of community resilience in long-term stress environments.},

abstract = {A series of six vulcanian eruptions at Galeras volcano, Colombia, occurred during 1992-1993. These eruptions followed the emplacement of a lava dome in late 1991, which was accompanied by cooling, crystallizing and partial solidification of the column of magma plugging the conduit. Five of the eruptions were preceded by episodes of monochromatic long-period seismicity, suggesting cyclic pressurization of the magma. The quiescent intervals between eruptions generally decreased with each successive eruption. We propose a model of gas release from magma into confined, stationary pore spaces by 5-10{\%} crystallization of anhydrous minerals, causing repeated overpressurization of the magmatic system. Using initial lithostatic pressures of 20-100 MPa (800-3900 m depth), gas buildup by crystallization indicates overpressures of 3-17 MPa, which is the approximate fracture criterion for a magma chamber. Our Galeras data suggest two models of pressurization: (1) gas exsolution may have occurred at similar depths, but with progressively smaller overpressures being developed before each successive eruption. According to this model, the comparatively long quiescent periods between the first eruptions resulted in relatively large amounts of gas exsolution from the magma and accumulation in pore spaces, whereas the shorter quiescent periods for the later eruptions exsolved less gas. The decrease in overpressure with time may have resulted from progressive fracturing of partly solidified magma during the eruptions, which progressively decreased the tensile strength and increased the permeability of the magma. (2) Since overpressures are smaller at shallower depths for a given amount of crystallization, the first eruptions of 1992-1993 were caused by gas exsolution at shallow depths, while the last eruptions, having shorter quiescent intervals, resulted from a greater amount of gas exsolution at greater depths. In this case, the rate of gas exsolution varied as a function of depth. The two scenarios for pressurization may be combined into a more general model involving edifice weakening and the development of a shallow hydrothermal system from continued degassing of the magma plug. As weakening of the edifice formed an extensive system of fractures, the shallow hydrothermal system deepened due to meteoric water input and magmatic degassing. With time, a greater number of fractures were filled and partly sealed by hydrothermal minerals at progressively deeper levels. As a result, the source of the overpressure also deepened with time.},

Knowledge of ejection velocity is crucial for understanding and modeling relevant physical processes of an eruption, and yet direct measurements are still a difficult task with largely variable results. Here we apply pioneering high-speed imaging to measure the ejection velocity of pyroclasts from Strombolian explosive eruptions with an unparalleled temporal resolution. Measured supersonic velocities, up to 405 m/s, are twice higher than previously reported for such eruptions. Individual Strombolian explosions include multiple, sub-second-lasting ejection pulses characterized by an exponential decay of velocity. When fitted with an empirical model from shock-tube experiments literature, this decay allows constraining the length of the pressurized gas pockets responsible for the ejection pulses. These results directly impact eruption modeling and related hazard assessment, as well as the interpretation of geophysical signals from monitoring networks.},

abstract = {Under a complex geological region influenced by the subduction of the Pacific plate, Kamchatka Peninsula is one of the most active volcanic arcs in the Pacific Rim. Due to logistical difficulty in instrumentation, shallow magma plumbing systems beneath some of the Kamchatkan volcanoes are poorly understood. InSAR offers a safe and quick method for monitoring volcanic deformation with a high spatial resolution. In this study, a group of satellite radar interferograms that span the time interval from 2000 to 2010 shows eruptive and non-eruptive deformation at Karymsky Volcanic Center (KVC), Kamchatka, Russia. All the interferograms provide details of the activity around the KVC during 2000-2010, as follows: (1) from 2000 to 2004, the Karymsky-AN (Akademia Nauk) area deflated and the MS (Maly Semyachik) area inflated, (2) from 2004 to 2006, the Karymsky-AN area deflated with ongoing eruption, while the MS area subsided without eruption, (3) from 2006 to 2008, as with 2000-2004, the Karymsky-AN area deflated and the MS area inflated, (4) from 2008 to 2010, the Karymsky-AN area inflated up to 3 cm, and the MS area subsided. Point source models suggest that two magma reservoirs provide a good fit to the observed deformation. One source is located beneath the area between Karymsky and AN at a depth of approximately 7.0 km, and the other one is situated beneath MS at a depth of around 5.8 km. Synchronous deformation patterns suggest that two magma systems are fed from the same deep magma source and connected by a fracture zone. The InSAR results are consistent with GPS ground deformation measurements, seismic data, and petrological constraints.},

@article{Browne2017a,
abstract = {The Golden Trout Volcanic Field (GTVF) produced the only Quaternary eruptions of mafic magma within the southern Sierra Nevada block. Approximately 38 × 106 m3 of basalt, trachy-basalt, basaltic trachy-andesite, and basaltic andesite (50.1–56.1{\%} SiO2, 1.1–1.9{\%} K2O, and 5.4–9.1{\%} MgO) was erupted from four vents within a {\~{}} 10 km2 portion of the GTVF, which also includes rhyolite domes that are not considered in this study. The vents include, from oldest to youngest: Little Whitney Cone, South Fork Cone, Tunnel Cone, and unglaciated Groundhog Cone. Little Whitney Cone is a 120 m-high pile of olivine-CPX-phyric scoria produced during a Strombolian-style eruption overlying two columnar jointed lava flows. Tunnel Cone formed through a Hawaiian-style eruption along a 400 m-long north-south trending fissure that excavated at least three 25–65 m-wide craters. Crater walls up to 12 m high are composed of plagioclase-olivine-phyric spatter-fed flows that dip radially away from the crater center and crumble to form Tunnel Cone's steep unconsolidated flanks. South Fork Cone is a 170 m-high pile of plagioclase-olivine-phyric scoria that formed during Strombolian to violent Strombolian eruptions. South Fork Cone overlies the South Fork Cone lava, a 9.5 km-long flow ({\~{}} 12 × 106 km3) that reached the Kern River Canyon to the west. Scoria and airfall deposits originating from South Fork Cone are located up to 2 km from the vent. Groundhog Cone is a 140 m-tall cinder and spatter cone breached on the north flank by a 13 × 106 m3 lava flow that partially buried the South Fork Cone lava and extends 7.5 km west to Kern River Canyon. Incompatible trace element concentrations and ratios show vent-specific trends but are unsystematic when plotted in terms of all mafic GTVF vents, implying that GTVF basalts were derived from a lithospheric mantle source and ascended through thick granitic Sierra Nevada crust as discrete batches that underwent different degrees of crustal contamination, differentiation, and magma mixing. Clinopyroxene-liquid thermobarometry calculations of the oldest and most primitive GTVF sample indicate that most clinopyroxene crystals record nucleation conditions of 1172–1196 °C and 896–1115 MPa. These pressures correspond to depths equivalent to, or up to 10 km shallower than, the Moho in this region. Deposits from the oldest GTVF vents are more primitive and homogeneous in terms of major and trace element concentrations, phenocryst textures and compositions, and their general absence of crustal xenoliths and xenocrysts compared to younger eruptive products. The eruption rate of the GTVF ({\~{}} 0.05 km3/Myr) is two orders of magnitude less than neighboring and contemporaneous Big Pine and Coso volcanic fields to the north and east, respectively. We interpret these differences to result from a relative lack of strain in the GTVF region of the southern Sierra Nevada block, which limits magma accumulation and ascent.},

abstract = {Geysers are rare geologic features that episodically erupt water and steam. While it is understood that the eruptions are triggered by the conversion of thermal to kinetic energy during decompression of hot fluids, geysers commonly exhibit a range of dynamic behaviors in-between and during eruptions that have yet to be adequately explained. In-situ measurements of temperature and pressure as well as remote geophysical techniques have revealed oscillatory behavior across a range of timescales from eruption cycles to impulsive bubble collapse events. Many geysers, including Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park, USA, are believed to have laterally-offset subsurface reservoirs (referred to as a ‘bubble trap') that can trap and accumulate noncondensable gas or steam entering the system. The impact of a bubble trap on the dynamic behaviors of the system, however, has not been fully established. We constructed a laboratory bubble trap and performed a series of experiments to study how fluids oscillate back and forth between the eruption conduit and laterally-offset reservoir in-between eruptions. We present a new theoretical model based on Hamiltonian mechanics that successfully predicts the oscillation frequencies observed in our experiments based on the conduit system geometry, the amount of gas that has accumulated in the bubble trap, and the amount of liquid water in the system. We demonstrate that when scaled to Old Faithful Geyser, this mechanism is capable of producing oscillations at the observed frequencies.},

abstract = {Seismic records from La R{\'{e}}union Island very broadband Geoscope station are investigated to constrain the link between the 2007 eruptive sequence and the related caldera collapse of the Piton de la Fournaise volcano. Tilt estimated from seismic records reveals that the three 2007 eruptions belong to a single inflation-deflation cycle. Tilt trend indicates that the small-volume summit eruption of 18 February occurred during a phase of continuous inflation that started in January 2007. Inflation decelerated 24 days before a second short-lived, small-volume eruption on 30 March, almost simultaneous with a sudden, large-scale deflation of the volcano. Deflation rate, which had stabilized at relatively low level, increased anew on 1 April while no magma was erupted, followed on 2 April by a major distal eruption and on 5 April by a summit caldera collapse. Long-term tilt variation suggests that the 2007 eruptive succession was triggered by a deep magma input. 1.},

abstract = {Abstract Stromboli island has a complex geological history with repeated changes in the volcanic activity alternating with destructive events, caldera collapses and flank landslides. The last activity resulted in the creation of the Sciara del Fuoco depression which was modified by the recent 20022003 landslide. The variation in lithology, degree of tectonization and disturbance has resulted in the presence of a wide spectrum of geotechnical materials. This paper summarises the physical and mechanical properties of Strombolis intact rocks, rock masses and loose deposits, based on field surveys and laboratory tests. A new classification of the rock succession is introduced and four lithotechnical units defined: Lava, Lava-Breccia, Breccia and Pyroclastic deposit. The range of variability in bulk volume, porosity, intact rock compressive strength and geological strength index is presented. The Hoek and Browns failure criterion was applied for each lithotechnical unit and the rock mass friction angle, apparent cohesion, tensile and compressive strength, global strength and modulus of deformation calculated in a specified stress range.},

abstract = {Strombolian activity consists of a series of explosions due to the breaking of a large overpressurized bubble at the surface of the magma column. Acoustic pressure due to sound waves has been measured and analyzed at Stromboli for more than 50 explosions. Three parts can be distinguished in the acoustic pressure waveform, which are related to the behavior of the bubble before, during, and after its bursting. Before the sharp rise in acoustic pressure, the signal is dominated by waves with a frequency of 2 Hz, which develop on the nose of the bubble. They produce sound in air by imposing a rapid motion to the interface, and one could detect a bubble travelling in the uppermost 30 m of the magma column. When the bubble reaches the air-magma interface, its strong vibration, driven by a large overpressure inside the gas, generates the main event with a frequency around 9 Hz. After the bubble has burst, kinematic waves of frequency around 4.5 Hz are the main source of sound. They develop at the surface of the magma left on the conduit side. The three types of motion, although determined independently, give consistent results. Furthermore, combining the results obtained for the two types of kinematic waves, the magma viscosity is estimated to be of 300 +/- 65 Pa s, which is in good agreement with petrological constraints and corroborates the validity of our analysis. This suggests that acoustic measurements constitute a powerful tool in the understanding of eruption dynamics.},

Acoustic waveform inversion is complemented by analyses of thermal infrared imagery to constrain the volume and rise dynamics of the eruption plume. Finally, we combine results from the two methods in order to assess the bulk density of the erupted mixture, constrain the timing of the transition from a momentum-driven jet to a buoyant plume, and to evaluate the relative volume fractions of ash and gas during the initial thrust phase. Our results demonstrate that eruptive plumes associated with small-to-moderate size explosions at Santiaguito only carry minor fractions of ash, suggesting that these events may not involve extensive magma fragmentation in the conduit.},

abstract = {Large tube filling bubbles rising up through quiescent fluid in a vertical tube are commonly known as Taylor bubbles. Their apparent simplicity of form and behaviour has led to them being viewed and modelled as a paradigm for both large bubble dynamics, where there is no continuous gas flow, and slug flow for the case of continuous gas flow. Central to this approach is the question: what diameter tubes support stable Taylor bubbles? In this paper we examine the case of low viscosity Taylor bubbles through experiments and theory and show that they exist in much wider diameter tubes than had previously been reported. In order for the bubbles to be stable a settling period is required to allow the column to sufficiently quiesce. This settling period is compared favourably with the classical stability analysis of Batchelor (1987). We also observe such bubbles rising in an oscillatory manner if the gas input is abruptly curtailed. The oscillations match theoretical predictions well. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {Studies of maars and diatremes suggest a specific process in their formation. Magma rises along a fissure and contacts ground- or surface derived water. The resulting phreatomagmatic eruptions give rise to base surge and air-fall deposits consisting of juvenile and wall-rock material. Spalling of the wall-rocks enlarges the fissure into an embryonic vent. At a critical diameter of the vent large-scale spalling at depth and slumping near the surface gives rise to a ring-fault of large diameter and subsidence of the enclosed wall-rocks and overlying pyroclastic debris. This subsidence leads to a maar crater at the surface. Fluidization processes are active in the narrow vent and in fractures and faults inside the surrounding structure which subsides en masse. Various features of kimberlite diatremes seem to be consistent with this model. They extend into fissures along which hot kimberlite magma rose. The diatremes, however, indicate emplacement by a cool gas phase, probably steam. Indicators for subsidence along ring-faults may be large diameter of diatremes, slickensides on walls, saucer-shaped structures, subsided "floating reefs", concentration of xenoliths from specific horizons within certain areas, and zoning of diatreme rocks. It is suggested that formation of kimberlite diatremes may have been influenced by non-juvenile water. ?? 1975.},

abstract = {We invert for acoustic source volume outflux and momentum imparted to the atmosphere using an infrasonic network distributed about the erupting lava lake at Mount Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica. By modeling these relatively simple eruptions as monopole point sources we estimate explosively ejected gas volumes that range from 1,000 m3to 24,000 m3for 312 lava lake eruptions recorded between January 6 and April 13, 2006. Though these volumes are compatible with bubble volumes at rupture (as estimated from explosion video records), departures from isotropic radiation are evident in the recorded acoustic wavefield for many eruptions. A point-source acoustic dipole component with arbitrary axis orientation and strength provides precise fit to the recorded infrasound. This dipole source axis, corresponding to the axis of inferred short-duration material jetting, varies significantly between events. Physical interpretation of dipole orientation as being indicative of eruptive directivity is corroborated by directional emissions of ejecta observed in Erebus eruption video footage. Although three azimuthally distributed stations are insufficient to fully characterize the eruptive acoustic source we speculate that a monopole with a minor amount of oriented dipole radiation may reasonably model the primary features of the recorded infrasound for these eruptions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Chouet2006,
abstract = {[ 1] We present a model of gas exsolution and bubble expansion in a melt supersaturated in response to a sudden pressure drop. In our model, the melt contains a suspension of gas bubbles of identical sizes and is encased in a penny-shaped crack embedded in an elastic solid. The suspension is modeled as a three-dimensional lattice of spherical cells with slight overlap, where each elementary cell consists of a gas bubble surrounded by a shell of volatile-rich melt. The melt is then subjected to a step drop in pressure, which induces gas exsolution and bubble expansion, resulting in the compression of the melt and volumetric expansion of the crack. The dynamics of diffusion-driven bubble growth and volumetric crack expansion span 9 decades in time. The model demonstrates that the speed of the crack response depends strongly on volatile diffusivity in the melt and bubble number density and is markedly sensitive to the ratio of crack thickness to crack radius and initial bubble radius but is relatively insensitive to melt viscosity. The net drop in gas concentration in the melt after pressure recovery represents only a small fraction of the initial concentration prior to the drop, suggesting the melt may undergo numerous pressure transients before becoming significantly depleted of gases. The magnitude of pressure and volume recovery in the crack depends sensitively on the size of the input-pressure transient, becoming relatively larger for smaller-size transients in a melt containing bubbles with initial radii less than 10(-5) m. Amplification of the input transient may be large enough to disrupt the crack wall and induce brittle failure in the rock matrix surrounding the crack. Our results provide additional basis for the interpretation of volume changes in the magma conduit under Popocatepetl Volcano during Vulcanian degassing bursts in its eruptive activity in April - May 2000.},

abstract = {The gas-thrust region of a large volcanic eruption column is predominately a momentum-driven, fluid flow process that perturbs the atmosphere and produces sound akin to noise from jet and rocket engines, termed “jet noise”. We aim to enhance understanding of large-scale volcanic jets by studying an accessible, less hazardous fumarolic jet. We characterize the acoustic signature of {\~{}} 2.5-meter wide vigorously jetting fumarole at Aso Volcano, Japan using a 5-element infrasound array located on the nearby crater. The fumarole opened on 13 July 2015 on the southwest flank of the partially collapsed pyroclastic cone within Aso Volcano's Naka-dake crater and had persistent gas jetting, which produced significant audible jet noise. The array was {\~{}} 220 m from the fumarole and 57.6° from the vertical jet axis, a recording angle not typically feasible in volcanic environments. Array processing is performed to distinguish fumarolic jet noise from wind. Highly correlated periods are characterized by sustained, low-amplitude signal with a 7–10 Hz spectral peak. Finite difference time domain method numerical modeling suggests the influence of topography near the vent and along the propagation path significantly affects the spectral content, complicating comparisons with laboratory jet noise. The fumarolic jet has a low estimated Mach number (0.3 to 0.4) and measured temperature of {\~{}} 260 °C. The Strouhal number for infrasound from volcanic jet flows and geysers is not known; thus we assume a peak Strouhal number of 0.19 based on pure-air laboratory jet experiments. This assumption leads to an estimated exit velocity of the fumarole of {\~{}} 79 to 132 m/s. Using published gas composition data from 2003 to 2009, the fumarolic vent area estimated from thermal infrared images, and estimated jet velocity, we estimate total volatile flux at {\~{}} 160–270 kg/s (14,000–23,000 t/d).},

The pumices contain 58 wt. {\%} crystals dominated by plagioclase (mode An43) and hornblende, with lesser amounts of augite, titanomagnetite, anhydrite, apatite, sphene, pyrrhotite, and biotite enclosed in a vesiculated matrix glass with 68 wt. {\%} SiO2. Anhydrite forms subhedral to euhedral microphenocrysts without reaction coronas, as well as inclusions within the outer zones of major phenocrystic minerals. Inclusions of apatite and glass occur within anhydrite microphenocrysts. Anhydrite was crystallizing from the melt prior to eruption. Pumices resampled some ten months after the eruptions contain only 0.2 wt. {\%} SO3, and have only scattered remnants of anhydrite and traces of gypsum lining vesicles. A single rainy season in Chiapas ({\textgreater}4 m yr−1 rainfall) was sufficient to remove most primary anhydrite, which may be a relatively common igneous mineral, although rarely preserved in the geologic record. El Chich{\'{o}}n trachyandesites are relatively enriched in K2O, Rb, Sr, Th, U, Cs, and light rare elements compared to other andesites from Mexico and Central America. These enrichments may be related to the large distance from El Chich{\'{o}}n to the Middle America Trench, or to subduction beneath Chiapas of the Tehuantepec Ridge, a major fracture zone of the Cocos Plate. Major- and trace-element analyses obtained by microprobe and instrumental neutron activation are given for all major minerals and glass, allowing trace-element partition coefficients to be calculated. Sphene and apatite contain high concentrations of rare earth elements, W, Th, and U. Sphene is also highly enriched in Hf and Ta. Prior to eruption, the El Chich{\'{o}}n trachyandesite was at a relatively low temperature in the range 750° to 850°C, with fO2 above the Ni-NiO buffer. The melt was very water rich with some 4 to 10 wt. {\%} H2O; the magmatic water content was 2–4 wt. {\%}. The magma also contained an estimated 2.6 wt. {\%} sulfur (as SO3). Of this amount, 1.2 wt. {\%} resided in anhydrite crystals and {\textless}0.1 wt. {\%} in pyrrhotite.

This tremor is extremely stable in time both at the summit and at a distal (∼4 km) small aperture array. Infrasonic tremor is characterized by discrete high amplitude bursts with a cyclic recurrence time of ∼40 s and is well correlated (0.93) with seismic tremor. These new data are compared with previous datasets collected in 2002 and 2004 during different levels of activity. All data show the same persistent infrasonic tremor and have the same strong correlation with seismic tremor. The stability and correlation of infrasonic and seismic tremor indicate the existence of a sustained and continuous process, which we suggest is related to the gravity-driven bubble column dynamics responsible for conduit convection.},

abstract = {Volcanic processes occur in a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. However, a key step of magma ascent is recognizable in the dynamics of gas and magma in the shallow plumbing system, where volatiles play a fundamental role in controlling the eruptive style. With the aim of investigating shallow degassing processes, an experimental setup was deployed at Mt. Yasur, an active volcano located in Tanna Island (Vanuatu arc), from 9th to 12th July 2011. The setup comprised high-speed and thermal cameras, as well as a microphone, capable of recording both in the infrasonic and audible range. The analysis of acoustic signals, validated by observing images from the high-speed and thermal cameras, has enabled characterizing the explosive activity during the investigated period. Two types of explosions, distinct for spectral features and waveforms, were observed: (i) minor events, corresponding to small overpressurized bursts, occurring almost continuously; (ii) major events, characterizing the Strombolian activity at Mt. Yasur. By investigating variation in the occurrence rate of the minor events, we found that, on a short timescale, the dynamics responsible for the two types of explosions are decoupled. These results, together with previous literature data, bring additional evidence of the existence of distinct sources of degassing. Finally, major events can be distinguished as emergent events, i.e. long-lasting signals, corresponding to ash-rich explosions, and impulsive events, featuring shorter duration and larger amplitude.},

abstract = {Welding of pyroclastic deposits involves flattening of glassy pyroclasts under a compactional load at temperatures above the glass transition temperature. Progressive welding is recorded by changes in the petrographic (e.g., fabric) and physical (e.g., density) properties of the deposits. Mapping the intensity of welding can be integral to studies of pyroclastic deposits, but making systematic comparisons between deposits can be problematical. Here we develop a scheme for ranking welding intensity in pyroclastic deposits on the basis of petrographic textural observations (e.g., oblateness of pumice lapilli and micro-fabric orientation) and measurements of physical properties, including density, porosity, point load strength and uniaxial compressive strength. Our dataset comprises measurements on 100 samples collected from a single cooling unit of the Bandelier Tuff and parallel measurements on 8 samples of more densely welded deposits. The proposed classification comprises six ranks of welding intensity ranging from unconsolidated (Rank I) to obsidian-like vitrophyre (Rank VI) and should allow for reproducible mapping of subtle variations in welding intensity between different deposits. The application of the ranking scheme is demonstrated by using published physical property data on welded pyroclastic deposits to map the total accumulated strain and to reconstruct their pre-welding thicknesses.},

abstract = {A model is proposed to explain temporal patterns of activity in a class of periodically exploding Stromboliantype andesite volcanoes. These patterns include major events (explosions) which occur every 3{\^{}}30 min and subsequent tremor with a typical period of 1 s. This two-periodic activity is thought to be caused by two distinct mechanisms of accumulation of the elastic energy in the moving magma column: compressibility of the magma in the conduit and viscoelastic response of the almost solid magma plug on the top. A release of the elastic energy occurs during a stick{\^{}} slip dynamic phase transition in a boundary layer along the walls of the conduit; this phase transition is driven by the shear stress accumulated in the boundary layer. The intrinsic hysteresis of this first-order phase transition explains the long periods of inactivity in the explosion cycle. Temporal characteristics of the model are found to be qualitatively similar to the acoustic and seismic signals recorded at Karymsky volcano in Kamchatka.},

@article{Cannata2011,
abstract = {On 13 May 2008 an eruptive fissure opened on Mount Etna's eastern flank feeding both explosive activity and lava effusion from multiple vents for about 14. months. During the investigated May-September 2008 eruptive period, infrasound recordings from a 4 station-sparse network allowed tracking of the explosive activity in terms of location and dynamics. In order to focus on activity from the eruptive fissure, the infrasonic events generated by the summit craters were selected by using both spectral features and time delays between pairs of stations and excluded from our analysis. Then, to accurately locate events from the fissure, we used a composite method, based on the semblance and brightness functions. This enabled the study of the co-existence of more than one infrasound source and/or its migration along the eruptive fissure. Hence, results permitted us to discriminate the number of active vents and their location along the fissure even when, due to poor weather conditions, it was not possible to access the vents or carry out direct observations. The eruptive activity was characterised by variations in the number of active vents according to the overall intensity of the eruptive event. Variability of the infrasound waveforms highlighted either that distinct vents produced signals with different waveforms, or that single vents generated different events during distinct periods of time, or finally both the previous phenomena. We applied the strombolian bubble vibration model to model waveform differences and attributed the signal variations to bubble radius changes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Transitions between explosive and effusive activity are commonly observed during dome-forming eruptions and may be linked to factors such as magma influx, ascent rate and degassing. However, the interplay between these factors is complex and the resulting eruptive behaviour often unpredictable. This paper focuses on the driving forces behind the explosive and effusive activity during the well-documented 2010 eruption of Merapi, the volcano's largest eruption since 1872. Time-controlled samples were collected from the 2010 deposits, linked to eruption stage and style of activity. These include scoria and pumice from the initial explosions, dense and scoriaceous dome samples formed via effusive activity, as well as scoria and pumice samples deposited during subplinian column collapse. Quantitative textural analysis of groundmass feldspar microlites, including measurements of areal number density, mean microlite size, crystal aspect ratio, groundmass crystallinity and crystal size distribution analysis, reveal that shallow pre- and syn-eruptive magmatic processes acted to govern the changing behaviour during the eruption. High-An (up to ∼80 mol{\%} An) microlites from early erupted samples reveal that the eruption was likely preceded by an influx of hotter or more mafic magma. Transitions between explosive and effusive activity in 2010 were driven primarily by the dynamics of magma ascent in the conduit, with degassing and crystallisation acting via feedback mechanisms, resulting in cycles of effusive and explosive activity. Explosivity during the 2010 eruption was enhanced by the presence of a ‘plug' of cooled magma within the shallow magma plumbing system, which acted to hinder degassing, leading to overpressure prior to initial explosive activity.},

@article{Namiki2008,
abstract = {Explosive volcanic eruption requires that magma fragments into discrete parcels. Silicic magma can fragment through brittle failure or other processes that depend on the viscoelasticity of the melt. Owing to the low viscosity of basaltic magmas, however, the fragmentation mechanism must be different and will be governed by fluid mechanics alone. We perform a series of decompression experiments on bubbly Newtonian fluids with viscosities and surface tensions similar to those of basaltic magmas. For sufficiently rapid expansion, the bubbly fluid expands continuously, eventually tearing into several pieces. We find that the fragmentation threshold is governed by a critical Reynolds number of ??? 1, indicating that it is the inertia of the expanding fluid that drives the continued expansion and ultimate breakup into discrete parcels. Experiments in which the fluid does not fragment allow us to determine the gas permeability of the bubbly fluid as the bubbles expand. Permeability remains small until the volume fraction of bubbles exceeds about 70{\%}. We scale the results of the laboratory experiments to basaltic eruptions and find that the predicted fragmentation threshold is consistent with the exit velocities that characterize effusive and explosive eruptions. Our experimental results suggest that the mechanism for fragmentation of low viscosity basaltic magma is fundamentally different from that of high-viscosity silicic magma, and that magma with low viscosities can fragment easily. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Locations and focal mechanisms of long-period volcanic events observed at Aso volcano, Japan, are determined by wave-form inversion. Near-field broadband three-component seismograms of four to seven stations are simultaneously inverted in the time domain in order to find the six-component seismic moment tensor. A linear inversion is performed at each point of a 3D grid located under the volcano in order to constrain the centroid position and the focal mechanism of the source. The complete displacements, including near-field waves, in a homogeneous half-space for a general point source are taken into account. Inversions of 43 long-period tremors and six phreatic eruptions exhibit mainly an isotropic mechanism, with a minor deviatoric component that may originate from a north-south-trending crack. These events are all located in a small region at about 1.3 km depth beneath the active crater. The high accuracy, both of locations (a few hundred meters) and of focal mechanisms given by the inversion, is partly attributed to the rapid variation of the amplitude of the static displacement seen in the long-period part of the near-field seismograms.

abstract = {The study of active vent dynamics is hindered by the difficulty of directly observing features and processes during eruptive periods. Here, we describe some recent observations of the summit dome activity of Santiaguito volcano, Guatemala, from the vantage point of its parent, Santa Mar{\'{i}}a. We have taken 12 h of digital video of activity over a 3-year period, which includes 28 eruptions and numerous smaller gas exhalations. Santiaguito persistently extrudes a dacitic lava flow, and produces strombolian eruptions on the order of every 0.5 to 2 h; we have documented many of these eruptions as emitting from a ring-shaped set of fractures in the dome surface. The ring has apparently grown from 70 m diameter in 2002 to 120 m in 2004, which could reflect an increasing conduit opening. Eruptions typically consist of 30-60 s of vigorous emissions; measurements of emission exit velocities have ranged from 5 to 30 m/s. The observed ash bursts, correlated with measured extrusion rates, suggest an incremental plug flow through the conduit. Bubble generation and shearing at the conduit boundaries produce the ring-shaped ash and gas pulses. Continued field studies from this unique observation site may help relate summit emission characteristics to conduit geometry and eruption processes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Two types of melt-inclusion-bearing plagioclase coexist in the Uchino basalt, Izu peninsula, Japan: (1) dusty plagioclase with an Ab-rich core mantled by a dusty zone consisting of more An-rich plagioclase and fine melt inclusions; and (2) honeycomb plagioclase with a central core containing larger melt inclusions. The dusty plagioclase probably forms through partial dissolution of Ab-rich plagioclase, as dusty zones truncate the concentric zonal structure of the Ab-rich inner core. The honeycomb plagioclase is formed by skeletal growth under supercooling conditions. This is indicated by the euhedral geometry of the boundary between the inner inclusion-free and the outer inclusion-bearing zones of the honeycomb plagioclase which has a concentric inner core. Bimodal distribution of the chemical compositions of phenocryst cores and assemblages in crystal clots suggest that hybridization of basaltic and andesitic magmas took place before crystallization of phenocryst rims. The core-rim boundaries of phenocrysts derived from the andesitic magma and the basaltic magma have a rounded and a euhedral geometry, respectively. This suggests the andesitic magma was heated and the basaltic magma was cooled prior to hybridization. These features are consistent with the development of a thermal diffusive interface between overlying andesitic magma and underlying basaltic magma in a stratified magma chamber. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {The pressurization of pore fluids plays a significant role in deforming volcanic materials; however, understanding of this process remains incomplete, especially scenarios accompanying phreatic eruptions. Analog experiments presented here use a simple geometry to study the mechanics of this type of deformation. Syrup was injected into the base of a sand medium, simulating the permeable flow of fluids through shallow volcanic systems. The experiments examined surface deformation over many source depths and pressures. Surface deformation was recorded using a Microsoft {\textregistered} Kinect™ sensor, generating high-spatiotemporal resolution lab-scale digital elevation models (DEMs). The behavior of the system is controlled by the ratio of pore pressure to lithostatic loading ($\lambda$ = p/$\rho$gD). For $\lambda$ {\textless} 10, deformation was accommodated by high-angle, reversed-mechanism shearing along which fluid preferentially flowed, leading to a continuous feedback between deformation and pressurization wherein higher pressure ratios yielded larger deformations. For $\lambda$ {\textgreater} 10, fluid expulsion from the layer was much faster, vertically fracturing to the surface with larger pressure ratios yielding less deformation. The temporal behavior of deformation followed a characteristic evolution that produced an approximately exponential increase in deformation with time until complete layer penetration. This process is distinguished from magmatic sources in continuous geodetic data by its rapidity and characteristic time evolution. The time evolution of the experiments compares well with tilt records from Mt. Ontake, Japan, in the lead-up to the deadly 2014 phreatic eruption. Improved understanding of this process may guide the evolution of magmatic intrusions such as dikes, cone sheets, and cryptodomes and contribute to caldera resurgence or deformation that destabilizes volcanic flanks.},

abstract = {Basaltic pyroclastic volcanism takes place over a range of scales and styles, from weak discrete Strombolian explosions (???102-103 kg s-1) to Plinian eruptions of moderate intensity (107-108 kg s-1). Recent well-documented historical eruptions from Etna, K??lauea and Stromboli typify this diversity. Etna is Europe's largest and most voluminously productive volcano with an extraordinary level and diversity of Strombolian to subplinian activity since 1990. K??lauea, the reference volcano for Hawaiian fountaining, has four recent eruptions with high fountaining ({\textgreater}400 m) activity in 1959, 1960, 1969 (-1974) and 1983-1986 (-2008); other summit (1971, 1974, 1982) and flank eruptions have been characterized by low fountaining activity. Stromboli is the type location for mildly explosive Strombolian eruptions, and from 1999 to 2008 these persisted at a rate of ca. 9 per hour, briefly interrupted in 2003 and 2007 by vigorous paroxysmal eruptions. Several properties of basaltic pyroclastic deposits described here, such as bed geometry, grain size, clast morphology and vesicularity, and crystal content are keys to understand the dynamics of the parent eruptions. The lack of clear correlations between eruption rate and style, as well as observed rapid fluctuations in eruptive behavior, point to the likelihood of eruption style being moderated by differences in the fluid dynamics of magma and gas ascent and the mechanism by which the erupting magma fragments. In all cases, the erupting magma consists of a mixture of melt and gaseous bubbles. The depth and rate of degassing, melt rheology, bubble rise and coalescence rates, and extent of syn-eruptive microlite growth define complex feedbacks that permit reversible shifts between fragmentation mechanisms and in eruption style and intensity. However, many basaltic explosive eruptions end after an irreversible shift to open-system outgassing and microlite crystallization in melt within the conduit. Clearer understanding of the factors promoting this diversity of basaltic pyroclastic eruptions is of fundamental importance in order to improve understanding of the range of behaviors of these volcanoes and assess hazards of future explosive events at basaltic volcanoes. The three volcanoes used for this review are the sites of large and growing volcano-tourism operations and there is a public need both for better knowledge of the volcanoes' behavior and improved forecasting of the likely course of future eruptions. ?? 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

@article{Cashman2000a,
abstract = {The prevalence of andesitic and dacitic volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years has led to a new appreciation of processes typical of magmas of intermediate composition. Extensive syn-eruptive crystallization, driven by decompression and volatile exsolution, is one such process. A water-saturated melt that is decompressed isothermally from its liquidus must crystallize in response to the diminishing capacity of the melt to retain volatiles (particularly H2O). Only rapid magma ascent allows such a melt to reach the Earth's surface without crystallizing. Intermediate rates of ascent permit varying amounts of syn-eruptive crystallization, which in turn changes magma rheology and affects continued magma progress toward the surface. Feedback among magma decompression, vesiculation, and crystallization is poorly understood, particularly with regard to the kinetics of crystallization. Here we present two complementary approaches to the study of syn-eruptive, degassing-induced crystallization. The first involves projection of matrix glass compositions onto the well-understood Qz-Ab-Or ternary, which allows relative (quartz-undersaturated melt) or absolute (quartz-saturated melt) determination of magma equilibration (or closure') pressure. We show that glass composition (groundmass crystallinity) changes as a function of decompression rate, and that either very slow ascent or rapid ascent followed by arrest and shallow cooling can lead to extensive cotectic precipitation of quartz + feldspar. The second approach involves quantification of plagioclase textures, which provides a direct measurement of the relative importance of crystal nucleation and growth (J/G). This parameter can, in turn, be linked to the effective undercooling (supersaturation) experienced during decompression. Finally, we use phenocryst melt inclusion data to suggest that a substantial amount of phenocryst crystallization may also be explained by decompression of water-saturated melt.},

abstract = {The dynamics of separated two-phase flow of basaltic magmas in cylindrical conduits has been explored combining large-scale experiments and theoretical studies. Experiments consisted of the continuous injection of air into water or glucose syrup in a 0.24 m diameter, 6.5 m long bubble column. The model calculates vesicularity and pressure gradient for a range of gas superficial velocities (volume flow rates/pipe area, 10{\&}{\#}8722;2{\&}{\#}8211;102 m/s), conduit diameters (100{\&}{\#}8211;2 m), and magma viscosities (3{\&}{\#}8211;300 Pa s). The model is calibrated with the experimental results to extrapolate key flow parameters such as Co (distribution parameter) and Froude number, which control the maximum vesicularity of the magma in the column, and the gas rise speed of gas slugs. It predicts that magma vesicularity increases with increasing gas volume flow rate and decreases with increasing conduit diameter, until a threshold value (45 vol.{\%}), which characterizes churn and annular flow regimes. Transition to annular flow regimes is expected to occur at minimum gas volume flow rates of 103{\&}{\#}8211;104 m3/s. The vertical pressure gradient decreases with increasing gas flow rates and is controlled by magma vesicularity (in bubbly flows) or the length and spacing of gas slugs. This study also shows that until conditions for separated flow are met, increases in magma viscosity favor stability of slug flow over bubbly flow but suggests coexistence between gas slugs and small bubbles, which contribute to a small fraction of the total gas outflux. Gas flow promotes effective convection of the liquid, favoring magma homogeneity and stable conditions.},

abstract = {Pulsatory eruptions are marked by a sequence of explosions which can be separated by time intervals ranging from a few seconds to several hours. The quantification of the periodicities associated with these eruptions is essential not only for the comprehension of the mechanisms controlling explosivity, but also for classification purposes. We focus on the dynamics of pulsatory activity and quantify unsteadiness based on the distribution of the repose time intervals between single explosive events in relation to magma properties and eruptive styles. A broad range of pulsatory eruption styles are considered, including Strombolian, violent Strombolian and Vulcanian explosions. We find a general relationship between the median of the observed repose times in eruptive sequences and the viscosity of magma given by $\eta$ ≈ 100.tmedian. This relationship applies to the complete range of magma viscosities considered in our study (102 to 109 Pas) regardless of the eruption length, eruptive style and associated plume heights, suggesting that viscosity is the main magma property controlling eruption periodicity. Furthermore, the analysis of the explosive sequences in terms of failure time through statistical survival analysis provides further information: dynamics of pulsatory activity can be successfully described in terms of frequency and regularity of the explosions, quantified based on the log-logistic distribution. A linear relationship is identified between the log-logistic parameters, $\mu$ and s. This relationship is useful for quantifying differences among eruptive styles from very frequent and regular mafic events (Strombolian activity) to more sporadic and irregular Vulcanian explosions in silicic systems. The time scale controlled by the parameter $\mu$, as a function of the median of the distribution, can be therefore correlated with the viscosity of magmas; while the complexity of the erupting system, including magma rise rate, degassing and fragmentation efficiency, can be also described based on the log-logistic parameter s, which is found to increase from regular mafic systems to highly variable silicic systems. These results suggest that the periodicity of explosions, quantified in terms of the distribution of repose times, can give fundamental information about the system dynamics and change regularly across eruptive styles (i.e., Strombolian to Vulcanian), allowing for direct comparison and quantification of different types of pulsatory activity during these eruptions.},

abstract = {A new way to study the dynamics of explosive behaviour at different vents of Stromboli volcano is proposed. The method is based on computer processing of images taken by an infrared film camera, at a rate of 4 pictures per second. Each picture has been digitized by use of an image scanner with a 75 d.p.i. (dots per inch) resolution and 256 levels of gray, then processed and the total mass of the ejected material has been calculated for each photograph. With this procedure the flux of ejected matter throughout every single explosive event has been reconstructed. The analysis of trajectories made on adequate samples of ejecta has allowed us to evaluate the ejection velocity. The mode of the mass flux distribution and the mean value of the velocities calculated for individual particles quantify the kinetic energy of an explosion. Vents nos. 1 and 3, which remained active after the last effusive eruption of 1985-1986, show several explosive patterns, the energy of which is measured. The observed flux distributions have been checked both numerically and experimentally by modelling impulsive events. The computer simulations of the mass distributions have allowed us to speculate on the possible explosive dynamisms. Two different models have been used: a single impulse model confirms the behaviour actually shown by one of the two vents, while the behaviour of the other is better depicted by a cumulative trend of successive impulses in rhythmic sequence. Moreover, through the experimental approach we have had the opportunity to test the overall resolution of the method. The observed matter flux distribution has then been associated to the seismic signals in order to correlate the dynamics involved in the explosions with the seismic source mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Solutions of gum rosin and acetone reproduce the volatile- and temperature-dependent viscosity, together with the phase behaviour, of hydrated magmas. A range of experimental exsolution conditions was investigated, including the variation of supersaturation, rate of decompression, solution temperature and volatile content. Degassing processes were controlled by the formation of an exsolution interface above a supersaturated liquid. The end-products ranged from a mildly degassed liquid to a solid foam, which preserved strained vesicles. Solutions of gum rosin and acetone are proposed as a suitable analogue system with which to study magma degassing processes.},

abstract = {[1] Long-term seafloor deformations in the Logatchev Hydrothermal Vent Field (LHF) at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are largely unexplored and unknown, even though the LHF has been the focus of international research for many years. As seafloor tilt and vertical acceleration provide key information about seafloor deformations, the Bremen Ocean Bottom Tiltmeter (OBT) was deployed in May 2005 at position 14 degrees 45'11.7 '' N, 44 degrees 58'47.0 '' W, 3035 m water depth in the LHF. The OBT recorded 384 days and was recovered in January 2007. Strong tilt steps and strong gradual tilt changes over less than a minute to days in the range of some 10 mrad and aligned mostly with the topography possibly indicate nearby mass movements like avalanches of bulk material due to local uplift or subsidence or may show tectonic activity. A vertically aligned high-resolution microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS) accelerometer of type Servo K-Beam in the sensor package seems to be helpful to distinguish between tilt signals caused by a true rotation and fake tilt related to a transient translational motion of the OBT in a horizontal direction. Hodographs show elliptic motion patterns with about 1 mrad total tilt amplitude and distinct orientations of tilt toward hydrothermal vents. It is up to speculation whether the latter signals are related to hydrothermal fluid circulation. The amplitude spectra of these tilt signals and acceleration show discrete lines mostly between 0.1 and 50 mHz. The spectra show the periodic character of those signals and also proof that tides or bottom currents, which are known to show lower signal frequencies, or tremor, which generally has higher frequencies, are most likely not the reason. Compared with studies onshore and offshore, the LHF is most likely an area of strong and highly variable seafloor deformations.},

abstract = {We use data from broadband seismometers deployedaround the summit of Kilauea Volcano to quantify the mechanism associated with a transient in the flow of magma feeding the east rift eruption of the volcano. The transient is marked by rapid inflation of the Kilauea summit peaking at 22 ttrad 4.5 hours after the event onset, followedby slow deflation over a period of 3 days. Superimposed the on summit inflation is a seriesof sawtooth displacementpulses,each characterizedby a suddendrop in amplitude lasting 5-10 s followedby an exponentialrecoverylasting 1- 3 min. The sawtoothwaveforms displayalmostidenticalshapes, suggesting process a involving the repeated activation of a fixed source. The particle motion associated with each sawtooth is almost linear, and its major swing showscompressional motion at all stations. Analysesof semblance and particle motion are consistent with a point sourcelocated I km beneath the northeast edgeof the Halemaumau pit crater. To estimate the source mechanism, we apply a moment tensor inversion to the waveformdata, assuminga point sourceembeddedin a homogeneous half-space with compressional and shear wave velocitiesrepresentativeof the averagemedium properties at shallow depth under Kilauea. Synthetic waveformsare constructedby a superpositionof impulse responses six moment tensor componentsand three for single force components. The origin times of individual impulsesare distributed along the time axis at appropriately small, equal intervals, and their amplitudes are determined by least squares. In this inversion, the source time functions of the six tensor and three force components are determined simultaneously. We confirm the accuracy of the inversionmethod through a seriesof numerical tests. The results from the inversionshow that the waveformdata are well explained by a pulsating transport mechanismoperating on a subhorizontalcrack linking the summit reservoir to the east rift of Kilauea. The crack acts like a buffer in which a batchof fluid (magmaand/or gas)accumulates a periodof 1-3 min before over beingrapidlyinjected into a largerreservoir (possibly eastrift) overa timescale the of 5-10 s. The seismicmoment and volume changeassociatedwith a typical batch of fluid are approximately TM rn and 3000ma, respectively. results 10 N Our also point to the existence a single of forcecomponent with amplitude 109N, which of may be explainedas the drag forcegenerated the flow of viscous by magmathrough a narrow constrictionin the flow path.

The frequency distributions of particle size and apparent velocities are found to be approximately log normal. The properties of the gas phase were inferred from the fact that it was the transporting medium for the condensed phase. Gas velocity and time variation, volume flux of gas, dynamic pressure, mass erupted, and density were estimated. A CO2-H2O mixture is possible for the observed eruptions. The flow was subsonic. Velocity variations may be explained by an organ pipe resonance. Particle collimation may be produced by a Magnus effect.},

abstract = {Meteoric waters from cold springs and streams outside of the 1912 eruptive deposits filling the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes (VTTS) and in the upper parts of the two major rivers draining the 1912 deposits have similar chemical trends. Thermal springs issue in the mid-valley area along a 300-m lateral section of ash-flow tuff, and range in temperature from 21 to 29.8°C in early summer and from 15 to 17°C in mid-summer. Concentrations of major and minor chemical constituents in the thermal waters are nearly identical regardless of temperature. Waters in the downvalley parts of the rivers draining the 1912 deposits are mainly mixtures of cold meteoric waters and thermal waters of which the mid-valley thermal spring waters are representative. The weathering reactions of cold waters with the 1912 deposits appear to have stabilized and add only subordinate amounts of chemical constituents to the rivers relative to those contributed by the thermal waters. Isotopic data indicate that the mid-valley thermal spring waters are meteoric, but data is inconclusive regarding the heat source. The thermal waters could be either from a shallow part of a hydrothermal system beneath the 1912 vent region or from an incompletely cooled, welded tuff lens deep in the 1912 ash-flow sheet of the upper River Lethe area. Bicarbonate-sulfate waters resulting from interaction of near-surface waters and the cooling 1953-1968 southwest Trident plug issue from thermal springs south of Katmai Pass and near Mageik Creek, although the Mageik Creek spring waters are from a well-established, more deeply circulating hydrothermal system. Katmai caldera lake waters are a result of acid gases from vigorous drowned fumaroles dissolving in lake waters composed of snowmelt and precipitation. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {[1] Discrete gravity data were acquired at Mount Etna over a period lasting more than a year and spanning the July-August 2001 flank eruption. The gravity measurements were made using a Scintrex CG-3M gravimeter along two profiles of Etna's gravity network. The gravity data indicate that during the second half of 2000, a mass increase of 2 x 10(10) kg took place about 1.5 km below the summit craters zone. It is thought to be due to a magma accumulation. A comparable mass decrease was detected during a 4-month period encompassing the eruption which is thought to be the result of withdrawal of the same magma. The gravity data also show that a mass decrease of 2.5 x 10(11) kg occurred between January and 19 July 2001 (2 days after the start of the eruption), below the southeastern sector of the volcano, within a volume around 2.5 km below sea level. This decrease was followed by a sudden increase that, in 14 days, partially compensated the previous variation. Since many tensional earthquakes took place during the first half of 2001, within the same source volume of the inferred mass decrease, it is reasonable to assume that the variation observed before the eruption reflects the formation of new voids by tectonic tensile stresses below the volcano edifice. Magma was emplaced along the new formed path from a deep storage to higher levels of Etna's plumbing system, setting off the eruption and causing the gravity increase observed soon after its start. Vulcanological, petrological, and ground deformation studies agree with the assumption of a batch of magma coming directly from a deep storage to have supplied most material extruded during the eruption.},

abstract = {Lava dome eruptions commonly display fairly regular alternations between periods of high and low or no activity with timescales typically of weeks to years and sudden transitions between effusive and explosive activity. We develop a transient model of the magma flow in a volcanic conduit from an open-system magma chamber with continuous replenishment. The model incorporates gas exsolution, bubble growth, gas escape through the magma, and decompression-induced crystallization and considers variations in magma temperature, water content, conduit diameter, phenocryst size, chamber volume, and magma rheology. Calculations show the presence of periodic variations in discharge rate due to the transition from a stable regime, when discharge rate is low and crystals grow efficiently leading to high magma viscosity, to another stable state, when discharge rate is high and crystallization is negligible. The difference in discharge rates between these regimes can be several orders of magnitude. Periods are similar to the observed timescales and mainly depend on the chamber volume. The system shows strongly nonlinear responses to the variation of governing parameters. If magma has a Bingham rheology pauses in discharge rate occur between peaks of discharge and the peaks are much higher than for the case of Newtonian rheology. Large changes in discharge rate and eruptive behavior can occur as the consequence of small changes in magma temperature, water content, phenocryst size distribution, or conduit diameter. The system can fluctuate between low and high discharge rates with transitions to explosive activity.},

abstract = {The eigen oscillation of a fluid sphere embedded in an infinite elastic medium is analyzed to understand the source mechanism of volcanic tremor that vibrates nearly monotonically and attenuates slowly. The dimensionless eigen frequencies of the sinusoidal oscillation are calculated in a complex form with the attenuation factor in its imaginary part for various combinations of the three parameters: the contrasts of P-wave velocity, density and rigidity between the fluid and the country rock. Eigen oscillations consist of a high attenuation mode with a rapidly decaying pulsive wave at a low frequency and infinite number of regular modes with slowly decaying vibrations. For regular modes, the frequency of oscillation obtained from the real part of an eigen value is distributed in approximately regular intervals while the attenuation factor from the imaginary part is almost constant independent of the mode. Each eigen frequency of regular and high attenuation modes is degenerated with two independent eigen functions describing different distributions of displacement, velocity and stress. The theory is applied to harmonic volcanic tremor observed at Kusatsu-Shirane Volcano, central Japan. Observed spectral peaks of the tremor are explained by the eigen frequencies and attenuation factors of several lowest regular modes if the spherical fluid oscillator has a radius of dozens of meters and a P-wave velocity of about several hundred meters per second. ?? 1995.},

Also, the bulk chemical composition of NWA 753 was determined. Bulk R chondrites have about CI chondritic (= solar) ratios of Fe/Mg (1.89), Al/Ti (18.62), and Al/Ca (0.94), while chondrules and matrix are complementary to each other. Mean Fe/Mg ratios in chondrules are 0.43 (NWA 2446), 0.36 (NWA 753), and 0.34 (Hughes). Chondrules are depleted in Fe, while matrices are enriched in Fe with respective values of 2.59, 2.45, and 2.39. Bulk Fe/Mg ratio of NWA 753, the only sample which is unaffected by terrestrial weathering, is reproduced by careful mass balance calculations using compositions and abundances of chondrules, matrix and sulphides from the same thin section. Refractory element ratios are also complementary: Al/Ti and Al/Ca are sub-chondritic in chondrules (Al/Ti: 10.43 in NWA 753, 12.24 in NWA 2446 and 11.47 in Hughes 030; Al/Ca: 0.66 in NWA 2446, 0.53 in NWA 753, and 0.46 in Hughes 030), while matrices generally have super-chondritic Al/Ca and Al/Ti ratios (Al/Ti: 28.00 in NWA 2446, 23.20 in NWA 753 and 19.00 in Hughes 030; Al/Ca: 2.30 in NWA 2446, 1.90 in NWA 753, and 0.41 in Hughes 030). Calcium is enriched in the Hughes 030 matrix due to terrestrial weathering. These complementary element ratios and the CI chondritic bulk strongly suggest a common reservoir from which all R chondrite components formed, similar to carbonaceous chondrites. Further, super-chondritic Si/Mg, and CI chondritic Fe/Mg ratios in bulk R chondrites require addition of Si to their reservoir, most probably before chondrule formation.},

abstract = {The edifice of Stromboli volcano gravitationally collapsed several times during its volcanic history ({\textgreater}100 ka - present). The largest Holocene event occurred during the final stage of the Neostromboli activity (∼13-5 ka), and was accompanied by the emplacement of phreatomagmatic and lahar deposits, known as the Secche di Lazzaro succession. A stratigraphic and paleomagnetic study of the Secche di Lazzaro deposits allows the interpretation of the emplacement and the eruptive processes. We identify three main units within the succession that correspond to changing eruption conditions. The lower unit (UA) consists of accretionary lapilli-rich, thinly bedded, parallel- to cross-stratified ash deposits, interpreted to indicate the early stages of the eruption and emplacement of dilute pyroclastic density currents. Upward, the second unit (UB) of the deposit is more massive and the beds thicker, indicating an increase in the sedimentation rate from pyroclastic density currents. The upper unit (UC) caps the succession with thick, immediately post-eruptive lahars, which reworked ash deposited on the volcano's slope. Flow directions obtained by Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) analysis of the basal bed of UA at the type locality suggest a provenance of pyroclastic currents from the sea. This is interpreted to be related to the initial base-surges associated with water - magma interaction that occurred immediately after the lateral collapse, which wrapped around the shoulder of the sector collapse scar. Upward in the stratigraphy (upper beds of UA and UB) paleoflow directions change and show a provenance from the summit vent, probably related to the multiple collapses of a vertical, pulsatory eruptive column. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

abstract = {SUMMARY  The explosions of Karymsky volcano often produce signals containing a sequence of repeating pulses recorded on acoustic and seismic sensors, known as chugging. The amplitudes of these pulses correlate with the time interval between pulses. For a given measured acoustic pressure, seismic amplitudes take on arbitrary values up to a specific, empirically determined threshold. Conversely, events with a small seismic amplitude yielded acoustic waves with large variations and large-amplitude seismic events corresponded to large acoustic waves. These observations are not consistent with a source modelled by a resonating conduit. Rather, a model consisting of a sequence of discrete pulses explains the data and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of degassing at the vent. The physical model for chugging involves a time-varying narrowing vent where gasses are released in a series of oscillations which appear to be harmonic but instead are modelled as short-term transients, or discrete pulses, suggestive of choked flow.},

SO2 flux measurements were conducted on 2 June 2009, when Mt. Asama was producing ash-free eruptions with VLP pulses. Gas bursts from a vent at the crater bottom following the VLP pulses provided an excellent opportunity to examine the relation directly. The SO2 emission for each eruption was calculated by integrating high temporal SO2 flux data obtained by the SO2 imaging system and subtracting the contribution from quiescent degassing from fumaroles around the crater bottom. A seismic moment of VLP pulse was estimated by the waveform inversion. We observed seven eruptions and obtained the proportional relation between VLP pulse moment and SO2 emission. The relation determined is consistent with the VLP source model; these observational results are the first report of a quantitative comparison between single VLP pulse moment and volcanic gas emission.},

abstract = {The rheology of volatile-bearing crystal mushes was constrained by deformation experiments on hydrous (2.52wt.{\%} H2O) haplogranitic magmas containing quartz crystals (solid fraction of 0.55 to 0.65) and gas-pressurized CO2-rich bubbles (bubble fraction of 0.09-0.10), under simple shear using a HT-HP Paterson-type rock deformation apparatus. Variable strain rates (from 5.10-6 to 4.10-3s-1) were applied at high temperature (823-1023K) and constant confining pressure (200-250MPa; 8-10km depth). This study shows that the rheology of three-phase magmas is strain rate-dependent (non-Newtonian behavior). Two non-Newtonian regimes were observed: (1) shear thinning (decrease of viscosity with increasing strain rate) and (2) shear thickening (increase of viscosity with increasing strain rate). Shear thinning results from crystal size reduction and shear localization, enhanced by the presence of gas bubbles in the weak shear bands. Shear thickening becomes dominant when the solid crystal framework induces internal flow blockage due to crystal interlocking. Compared to the rheology of bubble-free, crystal-bearing systems, the presence of limited amount of gas bubbles (maximum bubble fraction of 0.10) results in a prominent decrease in viscosity; e.g., at a crystal fraction of 0.70 a decrease of about 4 orders of magnitude in relative viscosity is caused by adding a bubble fraction of 0.09. This experimental study suggests that the contemporaneous presence of crystals and bubbles induces a significant difference in the rheological behavior of magmas with respect to two-phase (bubbles or crystals+silicate melt) systems. Crystallization and efficient gas removal from magmatic bodies in the Earth's crust lead to a substantial increase of viscosity and, eventually, to their "viscous death". On the contrary, the significant decrease of viscosity associated with the presence of limited volumes of gas could promote re-mobilization of large plutonic magma bodies and the generation of large explosive eruptions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Major- and trace-element systematics of the magmas erupted during the recent activity of Vesuvius (1631-1944) show that composition ranges are narrow and identical in each activity cycle except for the 1631 eruption which emitted also more differentiated products. These rocks are the most basic magmas erupted in Vesuvius. The high K and incompatible-element contents of these products are characteristic of the whole Roman-Campanian Province. Lavas and tephra of the 1906 and 1944 eruptions are highly porphyric. Geochemical modelling shows that these products are mechanical mixing of a slightly differentiated melt and various proportions of phenocrysts. Except ratios of highly incompatible trace elements (Th/La, Th/Ta, Th/Ba), no chemical characteristics of primary and differentiated melts can be simply inferred from bulk erupted products. An inverse method for calculating melt and mineral compositions is presented. Calculated weigth fractions are consistent with measured modal compositions. A model of crystal differential accumulation controlled by relative phase densities and eruption rates is proposed. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

On account of the viscoelastic properties of the fluid, the bubble is generally elongated. The associated frequency and duration of the acoustic signal are discussed with regard to the shape of the bubble and successfully accounted for by a simple linear model. The acoustic energy exhibits a high sensitivity to the dynamics of the thin film bursting, which demonstrates that, in practice, it is barely possible to deduce from the acoustic measurements the total amount of energy released by the event. Our experimental findings provide clues for the understanding of the signals from either volcanoes or foams, where one observes respectively, the bursting of giant bubbles at the free surface of lava and bubble bursting avalanches.},

abstract = {Seismic data recorded in the 2–30 s band at Stromboli Volcano, Italy, are analyzed to quantify the source mechanisms of Strombolian explosions during September 1997. To determine the source-centroid location and source mechanism, we minimize the residual error between data and synthetics calculated by the finite difference method for a point source embedded in a homogeneous elastic medium that takes topography into account. Two source centroids are identified, each representative of the distinct event types associated with explosive eruptions from two different vents. The observed waveforms are well reproduced by our inversion, and the two source centroids that best fit the data are offset 220 and 260 m beneath and ∼160 m northwest of the active vents. The source mechanisms include both moment-tensor and single-force components. The principal axes of the moment tensor have amplitude ratios 1:1:2, which can be interpreted as representative of a crack, if one assumes the rock matrix at the source to have a Poisson ratio $\nu$ = 1/3, a value appropriate for hot rock. Both imaged cracks dip ∼60° to the northwest and strike northeast–southwest along a direction parallel to the elongation of the volcanic edifice and a prominent zone of structural weakness, as expressed by lineaments, dikes, and brittle structures. For our data set, the volume changes estimated from the moments are ∼200 m3 for the largest explosion from each vent. Together with the volumetric source is a dominantly vertical force with a magnitude of 108 N, consistent with the inferred movement of the magma column perched above the source centroid in response to the piston-like rise of a slug of gas in the conduit.},

abstract = {[1] Sintering and densification are ubiquitous processes influencing the emplacement of both effusive and explosive products of volcanic eruptions. Here we sinter ash-size fragments of a synthetic National Institute of Standards and Technology viscosity standard glass at temperatures at which the resultant melt has a viscosity of ∼10(8)-10(9) Pa.s at 1bar to assess sintering dynamics under near-surface volcanic conditions. We track the strength recovery via uniaxial compressive tests. We observe that volcanic ash sintering is dominantly time dependent, temperature dependent, and grain size dependent and may thus be interpreted to be controlled by melt viscosity and surface tension. Sintering evolves from particle agglutination to viscous pore collapse and is accompanied by a reduction in connected porosity and an increase in isolated pores. Sintering and densification result in a nonlinear increase in strength. Micromechanical modeling shows that the pore-emanated crack model explains the strength of porous lava as a function of pore fraction and size.},

abstract = {Contemporary accounts of the violent eruption of Vesuvius in 1631 are reviewed, and recorded events are correlated with resulting volcanic deposits. Field study of the deposits in the proximal area revealed the presence of tephra falls, pyroclastic flows and lava, with subordinate surge deposits. A total volume of 1.1 km3 (0.55 km3 DRE) of phono-tephritic to phonolitic magma was ejected during 24 hours. The different magma compositions correspond with a transition from a lower, white, aphyric, highly vesiculated pumice (layer 1) to an upper, gray, crystal-rich, poorly vesiculated pumice (layer 3), showing reverse grading. Isopach and isopleth maps of the tephra-falls have been constructed to determine changes in the eruptive style and temporal evolution of the eruption column which reached a maximum height of 16 to 28 km. The recorded column height variations show a change in the mass discharge rate (8.9 ?? 106 kg/s to 8.2 ?? 107 kg/s) and the occurrence of pyroclastic flows during the deposition of the weakly vesiculated, dense pumice of the upper part of layer 3. Pyroclastic flows are crystal-rich and show St. Vincent-type features. The explosive phase demolished the upper part of the pre-existing cone, and debris flows invaded the southern side of the volcano. In the afternoon of December 17, 1631 an outbreak of lava flow from a southern lateral fracture system occurred, and effusion of lava continued up to midnight of December 18. Intermittent steam blasts continued to the end of December, when the eruption ended and Mount Vesuvius entered a solfataric phase. The earthquakes that had marked both the pre-eruptive and eruptive phases, continued, however, well into March 1632. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {We examine the initial phases of explosion earthquakes accompanying Vulcanian eruptions at Lokon-Empung volcano in Indonesia to reveal the triggering process of explosive eruptions. In 2012-2013, 56 Vulcanian eruptions at Lokon-Empung were observed by our temporary observation network being comprised of four broadband seismometers and two infrasound microphones at 1.6-6.8. km from the active vent. The seismic records of each explosion earthquake share almost the same waveform characteristics of initial phases, consisting of a small compressional onset (P phase) and a subsequent large dilatational phase (D phase). Particle orbits of both phases show straight motion from beneath the active vent, which suggests that these phases are composed of a longitudinal body wave. For each explosion, the origin times of the P phase precedes 0.8-2.5. s before the occurrence of an explosion at the vent that are detected by infrasound data. Since the signal-to-noise ratio of the P phase is insufficient for a quantitative analysis, we analyze the D phase dominating the initial phases. Our analysis for the signals of 0.2-1.0. Hz shows the D phase are well explained by a cylindrical contraction source with a half-cosine shaped time function located at 1.0-1.3. km depth beneath the active vent. We also recognize that some explosions are followed by a prominent tremor that coincides with continuous ash emission (ET). The seismic amplitudes and intensity of the D phase of events in ET are larger than the explosions without accompanying tremor (EX). The frequency distribution of the time interval from the previous eruption is also different in the events in ET and EX. The implosion source in the initial phases of explosion earthquakes at several km beneath the active vent has been reported at Sakurajima volcano. Since our result shows considerable agreement with the previous works at Sakurajima, both Lokon-Empung and Sakurajima may share similar initial processes of Vulcanian eruptions.},

abstract = {The development of opposing continental subduction zones remains scantly explored in three dimensions. The Hindu Kush–Pamir orogenic system at the western end of the Himalayan orogen provides a rare example of continental collision linked to two opposing intra-continental subduction zones. The subducted plates feature a peculiar 3D geometry consisting of two distinct lithospheric fragments with different polarities, subduction angles and slab-curvatures beneath the Hindu Kush and Pamir, respectively. Using 3D geodynamic modeling, we simulate possible development of two opposing continental subduction zones to understand the dynamic evolution of the Hindu Kush–Pamir orogenic system. Our geodynamic model reproduces the major tectonic elements observed: (1) the deeper subduction depth, the steeper dip angle and the southward offset of the Hindu Kush subduction zone relative to the Pamir naturally occur if convergence direction of the subducting Indian plate and dip-direction of the Hindu Kush subduction zone match. (2) The formation of the highly asymmetrically curved Pamir region and the south-dipping subduction is promoted by the initial geometry of the indenting Indian lithosphere together with the existence of a major strike-slip fault on the eastern margin of the Pamir region. (3) Subduction of only the lower continental crust during continental collision can occur if the coupling between upper and lower crusts is weak enough to allow a separation of these two components, and that (4) the subduction of mainly lower crust then facilitates that conditions for intermediate-depth seismicity can be reached. (5) The secondary tectonic features modeled here such as strike-slip-fault growth, north–northwest striking extension zone, and lateral flow of the thickened ductile upper crust are comparable to the current tectonics of the region. (6) Model results are further compared to the potentially similar orogenic system, i.e., the Alpine orogen, in terms of the curved Western Alpine arc and the two opposing subducted slabs beneath the Alps and the Dinarides.},

abstract = {The statistical probability of a connected network of randomly oriented melt veins in partially molten mantle suggests that the critical melting model can account for observed (226Ra/230Th) isotope activity ratios. Similarly, if the reactive percolation model also includes such veins, then this modified model is also relevant. Critical melting models for the isotope activity ratios imply that material exchange between the melt and the residuum must be negligible. Hence, any diffusive exchange between the melt in the veins and the residuum must be limited. This condition suggests that the veins form a rooted system where several smaller veins supply larger veins. Further, the veins should be situated at least some decimetres apart, and the permeability constant of the residuum should be larger than [{\~{}}]10-10 cm2. These conditions ensure that diffusion does not change the composition of the residuum significantly. Using isotope activity ratios alone, it is difficult to distinguish between the percolative and critical melting models, because both can account for the observed data. The concentrations of incompatible elements in residual harzburgites and other evidence appear to favour the critical melting model. It is suggested that veins can form as the result of overpressure caused by an interstitial melt, because of the volume expansion during melting.},

abstract = {Characteristics of convective flows produced by buoyancy of small bubbles rising from the horizontal bottom of a thin water layer are investigated with laboratory experiments, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis for steady convection cells. Immediately after the production of bubbles, small plumes of bubble-contained fluid are produced by Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The laboratory experiment suggests that the convective pattern is modified from plumes to cellular convection when the plumes reach the top of the fluid layer. There is a tendency for the aspect ratio of the cell to increase with the bubble flux, and this tendency was confirmed by numerical simulations. The analysis for steady convection cells also derived consistent solutions: a convection cell with too large a horizontal scale cannot be sustained, and the critical scale increases with the flux of the bubbles. The convective patterns in the final stage depend mainly upon the volume flux (F) of the bubbles and the rising velocity (wb) of a bubble in a still fluid. According to the numerical simulation, the steady cellular pattern is obtained only in limited combinations of F and wb. It is also found that the steady organized cellular convection is only sustained in a system without diffusion of the buoyancy. If the buoyancy diffuses across the trajectories of bubbles, the cellular convection eventually disappears. In the final steady state the buoyancy is transported only by the rising velocity of bubbles. In this respect, this convective motion is quite different from B{\'{e}}nard convection where the steady cellular convection is maintained in a diffusive system. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We conducted rapid decompression experiments using bubble-bearing viscoelastic fluid in a vertical shock tube. We varied vesicularity ?? and pressure difference between the inside Pg and the outside Po of the bubbles, ??P = Pg - Po, to understand the behavior of bubbly-magmas under rapid decompression. We find that the potential energy, which depends on the initial vesicularity ??, Pg, and Po, determines the expansion velocity of the bubbly fluid during rapid decompression. Higher potential energy, caused by a higher ?? and a larger ??P, leads to faster expansion. The expansion style also depends on the vesicularity ?? and on the pressures Pg and Po. We observe five different styles of expansion during the rapid decompression that depend on ?? and ??P. When both ?? and ??P are small, "nothing" occurs. As ?? and ??P increase, the bubbly fluid reacts more violently. First, the surface of the bubbly fluid "deforms" and the fluid elongates in the vertical direction. For sufficient elongation the fluid can "detach" from the tube wall. As ?? and ??P continue to increase, bubble walls can break, a process we refer to as "partial rupture". Finally, for still larger ??P and ??, both bubble walls and plateau borders break allowing the fluid to "fragment" into discrete pieces and erupt explosively. Our experiments show that a larger potential energy, which results from higher ?? and larger ??P, causes a faster expansion of magma which in turn promotes fragmentation and thus explosive eruption. If we assume that the pressure inside bubbles Pg scales with the depth of bubbly magma, measuring the magma vesicularity in conduits or domes as a function of the depth before eruption would help assess volcanic hazard. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We consider the current state of our understanding of the rheology of two-phase magmas, that is suspensions of either bubbles or crystals in a viscous silicate melt. The discussion is restricted to strain-rates at which the suspending melt can be considered Newtonian. We start by considering the range of textures found in magmas and the bubble deformation and particle motions caused by shearing. We then review proposed models for suspensions, focussing on those functions of the form ??r=f(??) or ??=f???? that have been most widely used to describe magmatic systems (??r is the relative apparent viscosity of the suspension, ?? is the volume fraction of the suspended phase, ?? is the driving stress, and ???? is the strain-rate). Both theoretical and empirical methods are presented and then compared against the available analogue (i.e. non-magmatic) and magmatic data. The paper contains new data and significant re-analysis of previously published data. We present a new semi-empirical constitutive model for bubble-bearing magmas that is valid for steady and unsteady flow and large strains and strain-rates. This equation utilises a new parameter, the capillarity Cx, that encapsulates the combined effect of shearing and unsteadiness on bubble suspensions. We also present a new scheme for dealing with polydispersivity of bubble suspensions. New data on the rheology of particle suspensions undergoing forced-oscillations are presented. These data show that the Cox-Merz rule only holds for dilute particle suspensions ?????0.25. A re-analysis of all available experimental data that relate rheology to particle aspect ratio provides distinct curves of maximum packing as a function of aspect ratio for smooth and rough particles with magmatic data lying on the curve appropriate for rough particles. We analyse several rheological datasets of crystal-bearing basaltic magmas and find that they are in good agreement with the constitutive equations derived from analogue data. By contrast, the same equations do not agree well with data for high-viscosity, haplogranitic melts. This may be an effect of fracturing or viscous dissipation within these samples. The paper concludes with a practical 'rheological recipes' section giving a step-by-step method for calculating a constitutive equation for a two-phase magmatic suspension and assessing its likely accuracy. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Here, we examine how redistribution of differing grain sizes by sediment focusing processes in Panama Basin sediments affects the use of230Th as a constant-flux proxy. We study representative sediments of Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) time slices from four sediment cores from two different localities close to the ridges that bound the Panama Basin. Each locality contains paired sites that are seismically interpreted to have undergone extremes in sediment redistribution, i.e., focused versus winnowed sites. Both Holocene and LGM samples from sites where winnowing has occurred contain significant amounts (up to 50{\%}) of the230Th within the {\textgreater}63 $\mu$m grain size fraction, which makes up 40–70{\%} of the bulk sediment analyzed. For sites where focusing has occurred, Holocene and LGM samples contain the greatest amounts of230Th (up to 49{\%}) in the finest grain-sized fraction ({\textless}4 $\mu$m), which makes up 26–40{\%} of the bulk sediment analyzed. There are slight underestimations of230Th-derived mass accumulation rates (MARs) and overestimations of230Th-derived focusing factors at focused sites, while the opposite is true for winnowed sites. Corrections made using a model by Kretschmer et al. (2010) suggest a maximum change of about 30{\%} in230Th-derived MARs and focusing factors at focused sites, except for our most focused site which requires an approximate 70{\%} correction in one sample. Our230Th-corrected232Th flux results suggest that the boundary between hemipelagically- and pelagically-derived sediments falls between 350 and 600 km from the continental margin.},

abstract = {An array of nine three-component broadband seismometers was deployed in two different configurations on Stromboli volcano. The analysis of the seismic wavefield related to volcanic explosions revealed some observations which offer a completely new insight into the internal dynamics of a volcano. These new observations are restricted to the low-frequency range below 1 Hz and underline, therefore, the superiority of broadband recordings over conventional short-period observations. Surprisingly simple wavelets indicate an initially contracting source mechanism. Gas-jets, that could not be seen in a short-period seismic record at all, generate a clear dilatational wavelet in a broadband recording suggesting the same contracting source mechanism. The analysis of particle motion and seismic array techniques permits a location of the seismic source. We find low-frequency signals of 3s and 6s period that are not related to eruptions and do not share a common source with the eruption-related events. A video recording of visible volcanic activity at the crater region allows one to correlate precisely eruptive features with seismic signals.},

abstract = {Textural and chemical analyses of bombs quenched directly from a normal explosion at Stromboli volcano (Italy) were integrated with coincident seismic, acoustic, and thermal data. The data set defines a new gas-dominated type of “strombolian” eruption, named type 0. These events are char- acterized by high-velocity emission (150–250 m s−1) of a few relatively small, juvenile particles, with entrained non- juvenile clasts that previously fell back into the vent to be re-erupted. For the studied event, the explosion depth was more than 250 m deep, and the particles showed little resi- dence time in the shallow system. Slug ascent velocities over the final 20–35 m of magma-filled conduit, and the low viscosity of the resident magma, are all consistentwith simple bubble burst in a “clean” conduit. This conduit type and eruption style likely fit popular slug ascent and burst models used to explain “strombolian” eruptions. In contrast, the ballistic-dominated type of explosions (type 1) are associated with larger proportions of stagnant material in the shallow system magma mix. We argue that the additional volume of this stagnant material pushes the free surface upward.Because of the larger volume ofmaterial available for entrainment into a type 1 slug burst, which has to fragment through a thick cap of degassed material, type 1 events tend to be rich in particles.

abstract = {High-pressure and -temperature experiments on a bulk-rock composition representative of the groundmass of the Soufriere Hills Volcano andesite have allowed the phase equilibria of the system to be determined; these are then compared with the natural samples. Experimental conditions varied from 825 to 1100degreesC and from 5 to 225 MPa; the main phases observed were clinopyroxene, crystalline silica, amphibole and plagioclase. A relationship between plagioclase microlite size and anorthite content is identified in samples of the natural andesite. Large crystals ({\textgreater}60 mum(2) in area) have cores of An(60-75), whereas small crystals ({\textless}60 mum(2) in area) have cores of An(40-60). Experimental results show that if the magma is heated to {\textgreater}950degreesC the high-anorthite microlite crystals can form at magma chamber pressures without any need for a change in bulk composition. It is proposed that convective self-mixing occurs within the magma chamber. Geothermometry of coexisting plagioclase-amphibole pairs confirms the complex crystallization history of the natural samples. Analysis of natural glass samples has identified compositional variations that can be related to the crystallinity of the sample and also the groundmass plagioclase composition. Rapidly erupted pumice samples have high glass contents, lower SiO2 glass compositions and plagioclase microlites that are large in size ({\textgreater}60 mum(2)) and have a high anorthite content ({\textgreater}An(60)). Slowly erupted dome samples are highly crystalline and contain numerous plagioclase microlites of variable size and composition.},

abstract = {Strombolian type eruptions are considered to be generated by a sudden release of a large gas slug that migrates upward in the conduit filled with a low viscous basaltic magma. We examine volcano deformations caused by such a gas slug to understand the Strombolian eruption mechanism from geodetic observation data. We model spatio-temporal pressure changes in the conduit by using a gas slug ascent model presented by James et al. (2008). As a gas slug ascends in the conduit, its volume expands because of depressurization. Hence, the magma head lifts up in the conduit and the upper part of the conduit wall is stressed. In the conduit, magma pressure increases with depth according to the bulk density of magma: the gas slug part with a low density is characterized by a small pressure gradient, while the other parts, consisting of melt, are characterized by a large pressure gradient. We numerically calculate volcano deformations caused by the spatio-temporal changes of magma pressure predicted from the basic equations representing gas slug locations in the conduit. Simulation results show that the radial and vertical displacements and tilt changes indicate volcano deformations that represent the inflation originating from the stress increase at the upper part of conduit. As the gas slug reaches the shallow part of conduit, the rate of inflation observed in the radial displacement decreases, the vertical displacement starts to move downward, and the tilt turns to show down toward the crater. These deflation signals are caused by a moving deflation source in the conduit that is formed beneath the gas slug. Since these predicted features are not observed in the tilt records associated with explosions at Stromboli volcano (Genco and Ripepe, 2010), it is necessary to modify the gas slug ascent model or to introduce other mechanisms to better understand the magma dynamics of Strombolian eruption.},

abstract = {Broadband seismic data recorded 2.3 km from the active vent of Arenal Volcano, Costa Rica, provide new constraints on tremor source processes. Arenal's tremor contains as many as seven harmonics, whose frequencies vary temporally by up to 75 percent, from initial values of 1.9 Hz for the first peak immediately following explosive eruptions to 3.2-3.5 Hz several minutes later. We infer that gas bubble concentration is variable within the conduit and also changes as a function of time, thereby changing the acoustic velocity We infer that the source is a shallow, 200-660 m-long, vertically oriented 1-D resonator with matched boundary conditions, radiating seismic energy from a displacement antinode. Polarization analyses show that particle motion azimuths abruptly rotate, which may be explained by a decrease of the incidence angle. We suggest that energy is radiated predominantly from a displacement antinode that is changing position with time. Tremor consists mainly of transverse waves that travel at speeds of about 800 m/s. P waves in the magma conduit will couple very efficiently into S waves in the surrounding medium when there is virtually no impedance contrast between the two media for these two types of waves. The tremor at Arenal is similar to tremor at nine other volcanoes.},

abstract = {To elucidate the conduit processes controlling the amplitude of air pressure waves (A(pw)) from vulcanian eruptions at the Sakurajima volcano, Japan, we examine ash particles emitted by eruptions preceded by swarms of low-frequency B-type earthquakes (BL-swarms). We measure the water content of glassy ash, an indicator of shallow magma storage pressure, and vesicle textures, such as vesicle number density (VND). These data allow us to reconstruct the shallow conduit by comparing vesicularity with inferred pressure, and therefore depth, of magma storage. The results show that VND increases with depth, implying formation of a dense, outgassed magma cap underlain by more-vesicular, less-outgassed, magma. The VND and water content in the glassy ash positively correlate with the duration of BL-swarms, suggesting that such seismic signals reflect upward migration of deep gas- and vesicle-rich magma. Finally, it is determined that Apw positively correlates with VND, suggesting that the amplitude of the air pressure waves is controlled by the amount of accumulated gas- and bubble-rich magma below the dense magma cap.},

Since such a step results from a tilt change, we interpreted the observed trace as being a combination of rotational (tilt) and translational (displacement) motions. The apparent displacement step in the VLP signal indicates subsidence of the summit crater. Owing to limited data, we attempted deflating the Mogi source and simulating the seismic record including both motions. When only rotational motion is considered, the simulated waveform explains well the general features of the observed trace.

abstract = {We have conducted a parametric study and developed a new cell model describing diffusion-induced growth of closely spaced bubbles in magmatic systems. The model accounts for (1) the effects of advection of melt resulting from bubble growth, and its affect on the local concentration profile; (2) dynamic resistance of the viscous melt during diffusive growth; (3) diffusion of volatiles in response to evolving concentration gradients; (4) mass balance between dissolved volatiles and gas inside the bubble; (5) changes in the equilibrium saturation concentration at the bubble-melt interface; (6) total pressure within the bubble consisting of ambient, surface tension, and dynamic pressures. The results of this study reveal that bubble growth depends strongly on ambient pressure, volatile oversaturation in the melt, and diffusivity coefficients, but only weakly on bubble separation and initial bubble radius. Increased volatile oversaturation increases growth rate to the point at which it actually reduces time for complete bubble growth. This counterintuitive result is due to significant advective volatile flux toward the bubble interface during growth. Viscosity controls growth dynamics only for cases of high viscosity ({\textgreater}10(4) Pa s). The documentation of the evolution of gas fraction in the melt and bubble wall thickness as a function of time makes it possible to estimate bubble disruption thresholds which bear on volcanic eruption mechanisms. Model results can be applied to the larger-scale problem of magmatic degassing in terms of bubble coalescence, flotation and the development of foams in magma chambers and vent systems, and ultimately to the dynamics of eruption mechanisms.},

abstract = {Mount Shinmoe-dake, in the Kirishima volcanic group (in southern Kyushu, Japan), erupted in January 2011. The eruption style was initially phreatomagmatic, and then underwent a series of transitions from sub-plinian explosions to an extrusion of lava from the summit crater. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the cause of such changes in eruption styles, focusing on the conditions for the eruption to be non-explosive and for the lava effusion to cease. To examine the conditions in the conduit and magma chamber, a numerical code is devised, based on the one-dimensional steady flow model of Kozono and Koyaguchi (2010), who modeled a dome-forming eruption. We systematically search for a condition in which the magma would not be fragmented, but the initial volatile content in the magma chamber would remain constant and unchanged. We find that the high magma permeability and/or the high degree of lateral gas escape was needed for the eruption to be effusive, and we estimate the pressure decrement at the cessation of lava extrusion.},

abstract = {In August 2008 an unmonitored, largely unstudied Aleutian volcano, Kasatochi, erupted catastrophically. Here we use seismic data to infer the height of large eruptive columns such as those of Kasatochi based on a combination of existing fluid and solid mechanical models. In so doing, we propose a connection between a common, observable, short-period seismic wave amplitude to the physics of an eruptive column. To construct a combined model, we estimate the mass ejection rate of material from the vent on the basis of the plume height, assuming that the height is controlled by thermal buoyancy for a continuous plume. Using the estimated mass ejection rate, we then derive the equivalent vertical force on the Earth through a momentum balance. Finally, we calculate the far-field surface waves resulting from the vertical force. The model performs well for recent eruptions of Kasatochi and Augustine volcanoes if v, the velocity of material exiting the vent, is 120{\&}{\#}8211;230 m s{\&}{\#}8722;1. The consistency between the seismically inferred and measured plume heights indicates that in these cases the far-field {\&}{\#}8764;1 s seismic energy radiated by fluctuating flow in the volcanic jet during the eruption is a useful indicator of overall mass ejection rates. Thus, use of the model holds promise for characterizing eruptions and evaluating ash hazards to aircraft in real time on the basis of far-field short-period seismic data. This study emphasizes the need for better measurements of eruptive plume heights and a more detailed understanding of the full spectrum of seismic energy radiated coeruptively.},

abstract = {A study of a phenomenological model describing the spurt instability in polymer extrusion is presented. Following Georgiou and Crochet [J. Rheol. 38 (1994) 639], we assume a nonmonotonic wall shear stress versus wall slip velocity relation. In this way we obtain a two-dimensional dynamical system for the wall slip velocity and the pressure in the barrel, which is similar to the van der Pol equations. The well-known fact that compressibility and a nonmonotonic slip law lead to spurt is incorporated by assuming the flow in the barrel to be compressible. The obtained dynamical system allows analytical evaluation, and, most importantly, gives a clear exposition of the dynamics underlying the spurt phenomenon. We give explicit expressions for the oscillation frequency and the size of the spurt window. Shear thinning is shown to give rise to quantitative differences only. It reduces the size of the spurt window and slightly enhances the period of the spurt oscillations. The linear scaling relation between the period of the spurt oscillations and the length of the die and the barrel height, is demonstrated to be independent of shear thinning or the precise form of the slip relation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Local seismic and infrasound data are used to characterize the March-April 2009 eruptions of Redoubt volcano, Alaska. Data are from a network of ten seismic stations ranging from 2.6 to 21km from the vent and a single infrasound sensor 12.2km from the vent. Measurements were made for more than 30 explosive eruptions including the 19 numbered events that were identified during the eruption response. More than 30 smaller explosions were also identified. Measured parameters include onset time, duration, reduced displacement (DR), pressure, seismic energy, and acoustic energy. Results were compared with complementary gas and lightning data. Based on ratios of pressure to DR and acoustic to seismic energy we find that the initial group of explosive eruptions on 23-24 March was relatively stronger seismically and included the four highest DR values. We infer that these represent vent enlargement or stronger coupling between the magma and wall rocks. One event, at 12:31 UT on 23 March had an extremely high pressure of 250Pa for the initial pulse and was likely weakly seismically coupled. A second group of explosive eruptions on 27-29 March was relatively stronger acoustically. Deposits were finer grained and of different lithology, with less scoria and more dense clasts. These two groups may represent different modes of gas release. Cumulative acoustic energy as a function of time correlates well with comparable lightning and SO2 data, suggesting that all three provide insight regarding different factors of gas release for the eruption as a whole. The number of events identified depends on criteria measured, and depends on the goals of the investigations. Overall the eruptions were substantially stronger than recent eruptions in Alaska, with some durations exceeding 1h and pressures an order of magnitude higher. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Northeast crater is a pyroclastic cone near the summit of Mount Etna, built to its present volume (1 ×106 m3) by nearly constant strombolian activity since its birth in 1911. Detailed analysis of one typical photograph of a June 1969 eruption indicates that particles exit with a median velocity of about 51 m/s at angles distributed nearly uniformly between 70° and vertical. Ejecta consists of ash to 1-m bombs. Physical properties of ejecta include median bomb density, 1.53 g/cm3; particle size of ash found locally on the cone, 150 $\mu$; median size of bombs constituting the cone, 15 cm; sphericity of bombs, 0.78; and surface roughness of bombs, approximately 0.05. Ballistic analysis using these data and including effects of atmospheric drag shows that cinder cone morphology can be predicted by a quantitative model that is in excellent agreement with observed cone features. Cone shape or profile, rim location, limit of continuous ejecta, the ballistic limit (maximum range of ejected fragments), and the size and location of talus slopes are uniquely determined by fragment exit conditions and ballistics. The model suggests that cinder cones grow through four distinct stages: (1) simple cone, with mantle bedding and a low rounded rim, (2) onset of an exterior talus slope, (3) destruction of the original rounded rim by backward migration of the talus, and (4) outward growth of the talus slope beyond the ballistic limit. In the lunar exterior ballistic environment, cinder cones (if they erupted at conditions qualitatively similar to Etna's Northeast crater) should form tuff rings with low, barely discernible rims. Small dark halo craters and dark mantling deposits observed on the moon (such as those near the Apollo 17 site) may be lunar equivalents of normal terrestrial cinder cones. Clusters of such lunar cones might form continuous blankets rather than groups of discrete cones as they do on the earth. Martian cones, formed under the same conditions, would be more like lunar cones than terrestrial ones.},

abstract = {Various scaling relationships relate the height of volcanic plumes to eruptive source conditions, atmospheric density stratification, turbulent entrainment, and wind stresses. However, observational, analog, and numerical studies used to test these scalings capture only a narrow range of natural eruptive conditions. In particular, existing analytical scalings are not appropriate for the wind stress conditions typical of the majority of volcanic eruptions. Accordingly, we develop a new analytical scaling for the height of buoyant plumes rising in density-stratified uniform crossflows. We compare this scaling to existing analytical scalings (Morton et al. 1956; Hewett et al. 1971) as well as "functional" scalings (i.e., parameterizations expressed as a function of the Morton et al. (1956) scaling and a regime parameter related to wind stress, Degruyter and Bonadonna (2012), Woodhouse et al. (2013), Carazzo et al. (2014)) using the extensive experimental dataset from Carazzo et al. (2014) along with natural events from a new database including 94 eruptive phases. Our proposed scaling best predicts the height of experimental plumes, which enables us to constrain the ratio of the wind to radial entrainment coefficients. For natural eruptions, the Woodhouse et al. (2013) and Carazzo et al. (2014) scalings, which account explicitly for wind gradient, best predicts plume heights. We show that accounting for atmospheric stratification and wind improves empirical relationships between mass eruption rates and plume heights. For tested scalings, analyze of residual heights for natural eruption supports the hypothesis that volcanic plumes rise higher in a wetter atmosphere. Finally, for analog plumes rising under moderate to high wind stresses, we show that plume shapes evolve over the plume height, violating the self-similarity assumption on which all scalings and integral model results rely. We discuss consequences for relaxing the self-similarity hypothesis as well as potential improvements for standard integral plume models, in turn.},

abstract = {Dripping water from a faucet is a typical example exhibiting rich nonlinear phenomena. For such a system, the time stamps at which water drops separate from the faucet can be directly observed in real experiments, and the time series of intervals $\tau$n between drop separations becomes a subject of analysis. Even if the mass mn of a drop at the onset of the nth separation, which is difficult to observe experimentally, exhibits perfectly deterministic dynamics, it may be difficult to obtain the same information about the underlying dynamics from the time series $\tau$n. This is because the return plot $\tau$n-1 vs. $\tau$n may become a multivalued relation (i.e., it doesn't represent a function describing deterministic dynamics). In this paper, we propose a method to construct a nonlinear coordinate which provides a ``surrogate'' of the internal state mn from the time series of $\tau$n. Here, a key of the proposed approach is to use isomap, which is a well-known method of manifold learning. We first apply it to the time series of $\tau$n generated from the numerical simulation of a phenomenological mass-spring model for the dripping faucet system. It is shown that a clear one-dimensional map is obtained by the proposed approach, whose characteristic quantities such as the Lyapunov exponent, the topological entropy, and the time correlation function coincide with the original dripping faucet system. Furthermore, we also analyze data obtained from real dripping faucet experiments, which also provide promising results.},

abstract = {The effect of non-deformable inclusions on the frequency-dependent rheology of a rhyolite melt plus crystals has been investigated using a sinusoidal torsion deformation device for measurements of shear viscosity and modulus in the frequency range of 5 mHz to 20 Hz at temperatures of 750-1050-degrees-C. The relaxed shear viscosity and unrelaxed shear modulus of rhyolite magma (rhyolite melt plus crystals plus bubbles) decreases with increasing bubble content and increases with the addition of crystals. At a crystal concentration of about 45{\%} a relaxed value of the shear viscosity is not attainable. The presence of rigid inclusions results in an imaginary component of the shear modulus that becomes more symmetrical and shifted to the low-frequency-high-temperature range with respect to that for a crystal-free melt. The slope of log(Q-1) (internal friction) as a function of the dimensionless variable log(omegatau), is unaffected in the low-temperature-high-frequency range of crystals, with Q-1 almost-equal-to 1/(omegatau)0.5 (the same as for bubble- and crystal-free rhyolite). For the present type of suspension, the internal friction is practically constant and independent of log(omegatau) in the high-temperature-low-frequency limit (omegatau much less than 1). The shape of the Cole-Cole diagram becomes symmetrical and can be described as a Caputo body with parameter gamma almost-equal-to 0.45, whereas for bubble-bearing and inclusion-free rhyolite melts the shape of diagram relates to the beta-relaxation exponent with beta almost-equal-to 0.5. The present work demonstrates that magma may or may not follow a power-law rheology depending on the relative volume proportion between crystals and bubbles.},

The experiments show that there is a delay of similar to1-4 h in the nucleation of plagioclase crystals after decompression. Over the range of pressures considered, nucleation rates vary up to 32 sites/mm(3) per s, and increase with undercooling. The growth rate of plagioclase increases with DeltaT, reaching a maximum of 1.7 x 10(-6) mm/s at a P-f of 75 MPa. Comparison of the experimental results with natural samples of the Soufriere Hills andesite suggests that pumice samples did not experience any decompression-induced crystallization and therefore ascent from the magma chamber must have been completed within 4 h. Dome samples are variable in texture, but all contain numerous small microlite crystals with low plagioclase anorthite contents and larger microlites with albitic overgrowth rims. Experimental results show that these textural differences can be related to variations in ascent rate.},

abstract = {A fundamental goal of volcano acoustics is to relate observed infrasonic signals to the eruptive processes generating them. A link between acoustic power $\Pi$¯ and volcanic gas exit velocity V was proposed by Woulff and McGetchin (1976) based upon the prevailing jet noise theory at the time (acoustic analogy theory). We reexamine this approach in the context of the current understanding of jet noise, using data from a laboratory jet, a full-scale military jet aircraft, and a full-scale rocket motor. Accurate estimates of $\Pi$¯ require good spatial sampling of jet noise directionality; this is not usually possible in volcano acoustic field experiments. Typical volcano acoustic data better represent point measurements of acoustic intensity I¯($\theta$) at a particular angle $\theta$ from the jet axis rather than $\Pi$¯. For pure air jet flows, velocity-scaling laws currently proposed for acoustic intensity differ from those for acoustic power and are of the form I¯($\theta$)∼(V/c)n$\theta$, where c is the ambient sound speed and n$\theta$ varies nonlinearly from ∼5 to 10 as a function of temperature ratio and angle $\theta$. Volcanic jet flows are more complex than the pure air laboratory case, which suggests that we do not currently know how the exponent n$\theta$ varies for a volcanic jet flow. This indicates that the formulation of Woulff and McGetchin (1976) can lead to large errors when inferring eruption parameters from acoustic data and thus requires modification. Quantitative integration of field, numerical, and laboratory studies within a modern aeroacoustics framework will lead to a more accurate relationship between volcanic infrasound and eruption parameters.},

abstract = {An east–west trending, high-density seismic array was deployed along the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau to investigate its eastward expansion. The 160 km long array spans the Ruoergai basin, Minjiang fault, Minshan Mountains, Tazang fault, and West Qinling. The array included 330 short-period seismographs spaced at 500 m intervals, which recorded teleseismic 3-component waveforms over a one month period. P-wave receiver functions calculated from 35 teleseismic events provided an image of crustal structure. The results show a massive thrust nappe structure around the Minshan Mountains and beneath the Minjiang fault. We suggest that this nappe formed after the closure of the Paleo-Tethyan ocean. The resultant Triassic thrusting contributed to partial uplift of the eastern Ruoergai basin and the Minshan Mountains in middle-to-late Miocene time. Receiver function images show that the Tazang fault is a crustal-scale rupture cutting across the Moho. The western Tazang fault appears as a nearly vertical strike-slip fault accommodating left lateral shear at the terminus of the eastern Kunlun fault. After clockwise rotation from an approximate east–west orientation to a nearly north–south orientation, the eastern Tazang fault became a west-dipping thrust fault, which caused crustal thickening beneath the Minshan Mountains and the West Qinling. Our results suggest that late Cenozoic uplift of the eastern margin of the plateau is produced by eastward overthrusting and crustal shortening, processes that absorbed slip along the Tazang and Kunlun faults.},

abstract = {Laboratory flows, self-capped by high-viscosity fluid, exhibit vertical pressure gradients similar to those postulated within conduits feeding dome-building eruptions. Overpressure and pressure cycles exhibited at laboratory scale provide insight into the mechanism of tilt cycles at volcanic scale. Experimental pressure cycles correlated with the rate of gas escape, with pressure rise being controlled by diffusion of volatile into bubbles during times when gas escape from the flow was negligible. The increase in pressure continued until margin decrepitation created preferential pathways for rapid gas escape from permeable foam, thereby reducing pressure within the flow. As pressure reduced, the gas escape pathways sealed and diffusion repressurized the system. This implies that tilt cycles, such as those exhibited by the Soufrie`re Hills Volcano, Montserrat, result from a diffusively pumped process that oscillates around the viscous-elastic transition within the outer regions of the flow. Phases of open- and closedsystem degassing result, with gas escaping through fractures created and maintained by the flow process itself. Fluid-dynamically, this mechanism generates an oscillation between Poiseuille flow and plug flow, with a 1-D model of plug motion giving a reasonable representation of observation in both experimental and volcanic cases.},

Explosions were recorded at Stromboli using a small aperture array of 4 infrasonic stations, allowing precise vent location. The acoustic signals were delayed-and-summed, revealing the existence of two main groups of infrasonic waves. The NE crater produces short ({\textless}3 s) high amplitude (20-80 Pa) pressure waves while the SW crater producess mall acoustic pressure (10-30 Pa) with long (5-15 s) coda. The two groups reflect different in explosive styles and similar spectral content, centered on 5-6 Hz. When stacked together, acoustic waveforms for each crater reveal the same pressure pulse, which indicates a common source process. We infer that the acoustic onset at both craters is generated by the burst of a large gas bubble while the acoustic coda is controlled by a sustained pressure release.},

abstract = {The evolution of Earth's atmosphere on {\textgreater}106-yr timescales is tied to that of the deep Earth. Volcanic degassing, weathering, and burial of volatile elements regulates their abundance at the surface, setting a boundary condition for the biogeochemical cycles that modulate Earth's atmosphere and climate. The atmosphere expresses this interaction through its composition; however, direct measurements of the ancient atmosphere's composition more than a million years ago are notoriously difficult to obtain. Gases trapped in ancient minerals represent a potential archive of the ancient atmosphere, but their fidelity has not been thoroughly evaluated. Both trapping and preservation artifacts may be relevant. Here, I use a multi-element approach to reanalyze recently collected fluid-inclusion data from halites purportedly containing snapshots of the ancient atmosphere as old as 815 Ma. I argue that those samples were affected by the concomitant trapping of air dissolved in brines and contaminations associated with modern air. These artifacts lead to an apparent excess in O2and Ar. The samples may also contain signals of mass-dependent fractionation and biogeochemical cycling within the fluid inclusions. After consideration of these artifacts, this new analysis suggests that the Tonian atmosphere was likely low in O2, containing ≤10{\%} present atmospheric levels (PAL), not ∼50{\%} PAL as the data would suggest at face value. Low concentrations of O2are consistent with other geochemical constraints for this time period and further imply that the majority of Neoproterozoic atmospheric oxygenation occurred after 815 Ma. In addition, the analysis reveals a surprisingly low Tonian Ar inventory—≤60{\%} PAL—which, if accurate, challenges our understanding of the solid Earth's degassing history. When placed in context with other empirical estimates of paleo-atmospheric Ar, the data imply a period of relatively slow atmospheric Ar accumulation in the Paleo- and Meso-Proterozoic, followed by extensive degassing in the late Neoproterozoic or early Cambrian, before returning to a relatively quiescent state by the Devonian. This two-step structure resembles that for the evolution of atmospheric O2, hinting at a common driving force from the deep Earth. Some caution is warranted, however, because still more enigmatic contaminations than the ones presented here may be relevant. Gases trapped in minerals may offer important constraints on the evolution of Earth's surface, climate, and atmosphere, but potential contaminations and other confounding factors need to be considered carefully before these records can be considered quantitative.},

abstract = {Ngauruhoe cone, in southern Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, has grown rapidly over the last 2,500 years in an alternation of effusive, strombolian, vulcanian, and sub-plinian eruptions of andesitic magma. At times growth has been 'staccato' in fashion as evidenced in the historical record. Each historical eruption typically lasted days to months, alternating with repose periods of years to decades. Major historic eruptions occurred in 1870 1949 1954-1955 and 1973-1975, encompassing wide variations in eruptive style over short timescales. The early period of cone building appears to have been dominated by a more continuous form of activity characterised by a series of numerous frequent explosive eruptions, with associated lava flows. The 2.2-km3 cone has grown in a piecemeal sectorial manner reflecting constant modification to the morphology of the summit, which has funnelled eruption products to specific sectors of the cone. Eruption rates can be calculated on several different timescales. Discharge rates averaged over individual eruptive pulses vary by two orders of magnitude (2.7-280 m3 s-1), reflecting variations in high level magma ascent rates and processes such as degassing, which are, in turn, reflected in contrasting eruptive styles. Lower rates (e.g. 0.65 m3 s-1) are obtained by averaging the discharge over an entire eruption lasting several months and may correspond to the ascent rate of magma batch(es) feeding the eruption. The long-term growth rate of Ngauruhoe is 0.9 km3 ky-1. This is an average rate reflecting the long-term deep supply rate of magma to crustal reservoirs. By looking at eruption rates on these different timescales we are better able to constrain processes occurring at various depths within the plumbing system. There are few detailed studies of the growth patterns of young volcanic cones, but such data are essential in understanding the dynamics of andesitic systems. More than 60 lavas and pyroclastic units mapped on different sectors of Ngauruhoe cone have been correlated by flow chronology and their distinctive compositions into five groups. Although the cone has grown rapidly, Ngauruhoe shows little evidence for the existence of large crustal magma reservoirs and long-lived magma batches. Instead, abrupt and non-systematic changes in magma chemistry and isotopic composition between and within the five groups indicate that the volcano has an open-system, multi-process, multi-directional character and erupts small ({\textless}0.1 km3) and short-lived (100-103 years) magma batches with no simple time-composition relationships between successive batches.},

abstract = {Exploding volcanoes, which produce intense infrasound, are reminiscent of the veritable explosion of volcano infrasound papers published during the last decade. Volcano infrasound is effective for tracking and quantifying eruptive phenomena because it corresponds to activity occurring near and around the volcanic vent, as opposed to seismic signals, which are generated by both surface and internal volcanic processes. As with seismology, infrasound can be recorded remotely, during inclement weather, or in the dark to provide a continuous record of a volcano's unrest. Moreover, it can also be exploited at regional or global distances, where seismic monitoring has limited efficacy. This paper provides a literature overview of the current state of the field and summarizes applications of infrasound as a tool for better understanding volcanic activity. Many infrasound studies have focused on integration with other geophysical data, including seismic, thermal, electromagnetic radiation, and gas spectroscopy and they have generally improved our understanding of eruption dynamics. Other work has incorporated infrasound into volcano surveillance to enhance capabilities for monitoring hazardous volcanoes and reducing risk. This paper aims to provide an overview of volcano airwave studies (from analog microbarometer to modern pressure transducer) and summarizes how infrasound is currently used to infer eruption dynamics. It also outlines the relative merits of local and regional infrasound surveillance, highlights differences between array and network sensor topologies, and concludes with mention of sensor technologies appropriate for volcano infrasound study. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Volcanic ash containing glass, deposited above the glass transition interval, has the potential to sinter viscously both to itself (particle-particle) and to exposed surfaces. Here we constrain the kinetics of this process experimentally under nonisothermal conditions using standard glasses. In the absence of external load, this process is dominantly driven by surface relaxation. In such cases the sintering process is rate limited by the melt viscosity, the size of the particles and the melt-vapor interfacial tension. We propose a polydisperse continuum model that describes the transition from a packing of particles to a dense pore-free melt and evaluate its efficacy in describing the kinetics of volcanic viscous sintering. We apply our model to viscous sintering scenarios for cooling crystal-poor rhyolitic ash using the 2008 eruption of Chait{\'{e}}n volcano as a case example. We predict that moderate linear cooling rates of {\textgreater} 0.1°C min−1 can result in the common observation of incomplete sintering and the preservation of pore networks.},

abstract = {Gravitational collapses of the lava dome at Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills Volcano on 25 June and 26 December 1997 generated pyroclastic surges that spread out over broad sectors of the landscape and laid down thin, bipartite deposits. In each case, part of the settling material continued to move upon reaching the ground and drained into valleys as high-concentration granular flows of hot (120-410°C) ash and lapilli. These surge-derived pyroclastic flows travelled at no more than 10 m s-1 but extended significantly beyond the limits of the parent surge clouds (by 3 km on 25 June and by 1 km on 26 December). The front of the 25 June flow terminated in a valley about 50 m below a small town that was occupied at the time. Despite their small deposit volumes (5-9 x 104m3), the surge-derived pyroclastic flows travelled as far as many of the Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills block-and-ash flows on slopes as low as a few degrees, reflecting a high degree of mobility. An analysis of the deposits from 26 December suggests that sediment accumulation rates of at least several millimetres per second were sufficient to generate pyroclastic flows by suspended-load fallout from pyroclastic surges on Montserrat. Surge-derived pyroclastic flows are an important, and hitherto underestimated, hazard around active lava domes. At Montserrat they formed by sedimentation over large catchment areas and drained into valleys different from those affected by the primary block-and-ash flows and pyroclastic surges, thereby impacting areas not anticipated to be vulnerable in prior hazards analyses. The deposits are finer-grained than those of other types of pyroclastic flow at Soufri{\`{e}}re Hills Volcano; this may aid their recognition in ancient volcanic successions but, along with valley-bottom confinement, reduces the preservation potential.},

@article{Turner1981,
abstract = {The results of a continuing series of laboratory experiments, designed to model the fluid motions which accompany crystallization, are both described and related in a preliminary way to prototype flows in magma chambers. Previous experiments have demonstrated the importance of compositional inhomogeneity, produced by crystallization and melting in a thermal gradient and coupled with double-diffusive effects, in driving convective flows which result in thermal and compositional stratification in an originally homogeneous fluid. The present experiments examine effects produced in tanks cooled at the side, by the upward flow of a less dense boundary layer depleted in the crystallizing component as crystals grow on the side wall. These processes are examined in simple two and three component aqueous systems (H2O-Na2CO3, H2O-Na2CO3-K2CO3, H2O-CuSO4-Na2SO4) with one and two crystallizing phases. In each of these systems, an initially downward flow of a cooled boundary layer against the side wall is reversed as crystallization commences and depletes the boundary layer in the crystallizing component. Accumulation of this cooler but lighter depleted fluid at the top of the chamber produces thermal and compositional layering by a "filling box" mechanism, partly modified by interchange between the boundary layer and the convecting layers outside. When more than one component is present in the solution, the crystallization process produces a differentiated fluid column, i.e. one with compositional gradients which are different for each of the components. The compositional and thermal distributions within the fluid change with time, but finally appear to reach a steady state. These distributions are the integrated result of compositional changes produced by crystallization from a thin boundary layer, a small proportion of the bulk fluid which evolves in composition and temperature independently of the bulk fluid, in a manner controlled by the dynamics of the system. The paths of fluid evolution, and the resulting sequence and abundance of crystalline products, are very different from those predicted on the basis of simple thermally-driven crystallization in the static system. Disequilibrium effects, probably involving different kinetics of crystallization of different crystals, in part determine crystallization in the experimental system; these may or may not be important in real magmatic systems. There is still much to learn before even the behaviour in these simple experimental systems is understood fully, and the application of the results to the interpretation of the behaviour in real magma chambers in even further away. However, it is apparent that dynamic effects provide an additional degree of freedom in crystallization processes, and allow evolution of small increments of solution to compositions much further along crystallization paths than that allowed in static equilibrium systems. Petrologists will have to free their thinking from classical constraints of static systems in order to interpret many magmatic phenomena. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

In the vicinity of the fluid critical point, the natural convective circulation increases dramatically. Laboratory data are presented which show that heat transfer rates in a permeable medium can increase by a factor of 70 in the vicinity of the critical point. The conditions for this type of superconvection are shown to be compatible with expected geologic conditions above magma bodies in the crust. This enhanced heat transfer process has potential application to energy extraction concepts and is shown to be capable of yielding heat extraction rates of 12 kW/m2. A number of geophysical implications, such as shallow pooling of magma as sills, are briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {The May 1998 eruption sequence of Sakurajima Volcano was monitored by ten infrasonic stations, ten seismometers, and a video camera. During this seismo‐acoustic experiment, we recorded hundreds of infrasonic tremor and long‐period events associated with seismic signals, and observed a progression from relative quiescence to a Vulcanian eruption. The number of infrasonic events increased with escalating volcanic activity, and the dominant character of the infrasonic signals changed from impulsive to emergent. At 22:17 of May 19, Sakurajima released ash and gases to a height of 2 km above the vent, an event that was recorded continuously by one infrasonic and two seismic stations. We present the experimental setup as well as a procedure through which infrasonic signals may be incorporated into future eruption monitoring and forecasting algorithms for open‐vent volcanic systems. In addition, our recordings suggest that infrasonic signals are more representative of processes occurring within the volcanic interior than are seismic signals, which are strongly altered by diffraction and scattering in the volcanic edifice.},

abstract = {Approximate solutions are obtained for the stress and displacement fields due to a pressurized spherical cavity in an elastic half-space. The solutions take the form of series expansions in powers of {\&}{\#}949; = a/d, where a is the cavity radius and d is the depth. The leading-order term in the expression for the surface uplift, which arises at O({\&}{\#}949;3), recovers the well-known result of Mogi for the response to a point dilatation. The first higher-order correction accounts for a cavity of finite size and thus offers the possibility of fitting leveling data for not only the depth but also the radius and pressure increment. However, this correction is of O({\&}{\#}949;6) and, consequently, is weak. The result provides a formal explanation for the success of the point dilatation model in representing uplift data even when it is known independently that {\&}{\#}949; is not small. The higher-order correction causes the surface uplift to fall off more rapidly in the radial direction, implying that a fit of the point source solution tends to underestimate the depth d. In contrast to the surface displacement, the stress field near the cavity is affected profoundly by the proximity of the free surface. Three higher-order corrections to the stress field are obtained, which result in a uniformly valid approximation to O({\&}{\#}949;5). The hoop stress at the cavity exhibits a tensile maximum at the circle of tangency with a cone with its apex at the free surface. This result appears to be consistent with the locus of fractures radiating outward from the magma body inferred by seismic methods in Long Valley, California.},

abstract = {Effective natural hazard risk assessment requires the characterisation of both hazards and vulnerabilities of exposed elements. Volcanic hazard assessment is at an advanced state and is a considerable focus of volcanic scientific inquiry, whereas comprehensive vulnerability assessment is lacking. Cataloguing and analysing volcanic impacts provide insight on likely societal and physical vulnerabilities during future eruptions. This paper reviews documented disruption and physical damage of critical infrastructure elements resulting from four volcanic hazards (tephra fall, pyroclastic density currents, lava flows and lahars) of eruptions in the last 100. years. We define critical infrastructure as including energy sector infrastructure, water supply and wastewater networks, transportation routes, communications, and critical components. Common trends of impacts and vulnerabilities are summarised, which can be used to assess and reduce volcanic risk for future eruptions. In general, tephra falls cause disruption to these infrastructure sectors, reducing their functionality, whilst flow hazards (pyroclastic density currents, lava flows and lahars) are more destructive causing considerable permanent damage. Volcanic risk assessment should include quantification of vulnerabilities and we challenge the volcanology community to address this through the implementation of a standardised vulnerability assessment methodology and the development and use of fragility functions, as has been successfully implemented in other natural hazard fields.},

This agreement indicates that the 3He/4He ratio in the crater fumaroles faithfully tracks the magmatic value. The relatively low and uniform 3He/4He ratio in the lavas reflects either a mantle source enriched in (U + Th)/3He, or a mixture of magmatic and crustal components. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Field observations have previously identified rapid cyclic changes in the behaviour of the lava lake of Erebus volcano. In order to understand more fully the nature and origins of these cycles, we present here a wavelet-based frequency analysis of time series measurements of gas emissions from the lava lake, obtained by open-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This reveals (i) a cyclic change in total gas column amount, a likely proxy for gas flux, with a period of about 10 min, and (ii) a similarly phased cyclic change in proportions of volcanic gases, which can be explained in terms of chemical equilibria and pressure-dependent solubilities. Notably, the wavelet analysis shows a persistent periodicity in the CO2/CO ratio and strong periodicity in H2O and SO2 degassing. The ‘peaks' of the cycles, defined by maxima in H2O and SO2 column amounts, coincide with high CO2/CO ratios and proportionally smaller increases in column amounts of CO2, CO, and OCS. We interpret the cycles to arise from recharge of the lake by intermittent pulses of magma from shallow depths, which degas H2O at low pressure, combined with a background gas flux that is decoupled from this very shallow magma degassing.},

abstract = {On September 1, 2004, Mt. Asama in central Japan erupted for the first time in 21 years. Between this moderate eruption and mid-November of the same year, 4 additional moderate eruptions occurred. We installed 8 broadband seismic stations in addition to the short period seismic network around the volcano and succeeded in recording the near-field seismic signals associated with the summit eruptions. The results of the waveform inversions clearly show that the force system exerted at the source region is dominated by vertical single force components. The source depths of the single force are shallower than 200 m from the bottom of the summit crater, and the order of magnitude of the single force is 10(10)-10(11)N. The source time history of each vertical single force component consists of two downward forces and one upward force. The initial downward force probably corresponds to the sudden removal of a lid capping the pressurized conduit. The drag force due to viscous magma moving upward in the conduit can explain the upward force. The correlation between the single force amplitudes and the amounts of volcanic deposits emitted from the summit crater are not necessarily positive, suggesting that the amount of deposits remaining within the summit crater may have played an important role in the excitation of the single force.},

For example, during eruptions, summit areas are very hard to be accessed because of logistics problems and/or volcanic hazards. The use of remote sensing techniques in the last 20 years by satellite or airborne platforms has proven their capabilities in mapping and monitoring the evolution of volcanic activity. This approach has become increasingly important, as much interest is actually focused on understanding precursory signals to volcanic eruptions. In this work we verify the use of cutting-edge technology like unmanned flying system thermally equipped for volcanic applications. We present the results of a flight test performed by INGV in collaboration with the University of Bologna (Aerospace Division) by using a multi-rotor aircraft in a hexacopter configuration. The experiment was realized in radio controlled mode to overcome many regulation problems which, especially in Italy, limit the use of this system in autonomous mode. The overall goal was not only qualitative but also quantitative oriented. The system flew above an Italian mud volcano, named Le Salinelle, located on the lower South West flank of Mt. Etna volcano, which was chosen as representative site, providing not only a discrimination between hot and cold areas, but also the corresponding temperature values. The in-flight measurements have been cross-validated with contemporaneous in-situ acquisition of thermal data and from independent measurements of mud/water temperature.},

abstract = {Two contrasting models of the dynamics of explosive basaltic eruptions are in current usage. These are referred to as the rise speed dependent (RSD) model and the collapsing foam (CF) model. The basic assumptions of each model are examined, and it is found that neither model is flawed in any fundamental way. The models are then compared as to how well they reproduce observed Strombolian, Hawaiian and transitional eruptive behaviour. It is shown that the models do not differ greatly in their treatment of Strombolian eruptions. The models of Hawaiian eruptions are, however, very different from each other. A detailed examination of the 1983-1986 Pu'u 'O'o eruption finds that the CF model is inconsistent with observed activity in a number of important aspects. By contrast, the RSD model is consistent with the observed activity. The issues raised in the application of the CF model to this eruption draw into doubt its validity as a model of Hawaiian activity. Transitional eruptions have only been examined using the RSD model and it is shown that the RSD model is able to successfully reproduce this kind of activity too. The ultimate conclusion of this study is that fundamental problems exist in the application of the CF model to real eruptions. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
